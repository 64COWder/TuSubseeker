1
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:46,507
I'm in.

2
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:15,563
Oh, no.

3
00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:34,048
Kirsten Clark, this is a very serious

4
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,516
accusation against you.

5
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:37,184
You do understand that?

6
00:02:37,186 --> 00:02:39,800
I understood the first three
times you told me, Doctor Hardwyck.

7
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:42,923
Do you mind not doing
that while I talk with you?

8
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:45,192
Thank you.

9
00:02:45,194 --> 00:02:46,694
Do you have a response for Camille?

10
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:48,062
Yes.

11
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:49,430
Why would I sabotage her research

12
00:02:49,432 --> 00:02:50,931
when she's perfectly capable

13
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,600
of screwing it up by herself?

14
00:02:52,602 --> 00:02:54,135
See?

15
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:56,037
This is the crap I've been
getting from her all year.

16
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,538
I don't say this maliciously.

17
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,173
It's just that Camille's
work is often shoddy.

18
00:02:59,175 --> 00:03:00,541
I believe her grades reflect that.

19
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:02,410
We share a house, so she had access

20
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:04,278
to my optogenetics harness. Plus she wants

21
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,946
to publish first, so she has a motive.

22
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:08,616
I demand a full investigation,
and I want Kirsten

23
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:11,085
placed on academic suspension
while it's taking place.

24
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:13,120
This is about the dishes I
left in the sink, isn't it?

25
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:15,022
What? No. You think I want you

26
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:16,457
suspended because you
left dishes in the sink?

27
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,428
Would it kill you to clean up the
kitchen after you're done in there?

28
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,063
I don't know. Would it kill you

29
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:23,364
to close your door when
you have a guy over?

30
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:25,066
- That was one time.
- Kirsten, Camille,

31
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:27,168
I need you ladies to focus, all right?

32
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,603
Academic suspension is the nuclear option.

33
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:32,560
There must be some way Kristen
can prove she didn't do it.

34
00:03:32,674 --> 00:03:35,042
We also can't rule out that Camille
did this to herself to sabotage me.

35
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:36,577
I'll take a polygraph right now...

36
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,979
right now. How about you?

37
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:41,148
I'd fail.

38
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,751
That sounds like an
admission of guilt to me.

39
00:03:43,753 --> 00:03:46,153
Polygraphs don't work on me. I fail them.

40
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:48,489
Because of this condition
of yours... temporal...

41
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:51,025
- Dysplasia, yes.
- That's convenient.

42
00:03:51,027 --> 00:03:53,994
Kirsten, we run a strict code of conduct

43
00:03:53,996 --> 00:03:56,997
here in the PhD program.
Till further notice,

44
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:59,333
I'm gonna place you on academic suspension.

45
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:00,601
Sorry.

46
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:06,741
There, it's fixed. You're welcome.

47
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:11,512
Okay?

48
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,185
- Kirsten Clark?
- Yes.

49
00:04:18,187 --> 00:04:20,187
Detective Fisher, L.A.P.D.

50
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,091
I'm sorry, Miss Clark,
I have some bad news.

51
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:32,133
That's him.

52
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:34,068
- Would you like a moment?
- To do what?

53
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,103
To be alone with your father.

54
00:04:44,112 --> 00:04:45,312
Turn around.

55
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:58,325
Turn around.

56
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,171
No, I'm good.

57
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:12,473
The police department has
a grief counselor available

58
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:13,741
if you'd like to speak to someone.

59
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:16,177
- Are you sure he killed himself?
- Yes.

60
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:18,846
I think you're wrong.

61
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:21,115
When someone shoots themselves,
compared to when they're shot

62
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:23,384
by someone else, there are certain...

63
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:25,085
are you sure you want to hear this?

64
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:26,587
Certain what?

65
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:28,823
Indicators... powder residue
on the suicide's hand,

66
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:32,092
location of the wound, number of
shots fired, angle of the shot.

67
00:05:32,094 --> 00:05:35,095
Every indicator about your
father points to suicide.

68
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:36,630
He shot himself in the chest.

69
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:38,632
The head is favored by 75% of suicides.

70
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:41,101
Which means the chest is favored by 25%.

71
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:43,337
He obviously falls in that percentile.

72
00:05:44,406 --> 00:05:45,873
What about the gun?

73
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:49,410
It fell on the floor next to him.

74
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:51,111
- Near which hand?
- His right.

75
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:52,480
- He was left-handed.
- Doesn't matter.

76
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:54,281
- Why not?
- He shot himself in the heart.

77
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:56,517
It's easier to do that with
your right hand than your left.

78
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,589
We photographed the entire
room, over 400 pictures.

79
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:03,157
I want copies.

80
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:05,226
It doesn't work that way.

81
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:08,829
Why weren't you and your father close?

82
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:10,331
What makes you think that?

83
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,166
Because the usual reaction I see

84
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:14,435
when someone's parent is
killed is different than yours.

85
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,570
- You've seen a lot of that?
- Yes.

86
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:18,305
My heart weeps for you.

87
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:21,275
Why weren't you close?

88
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:24,178
- I didn't kill him.
- I wasn't implying you did.

89
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,281
Good, because I was in class
this morning when he was murdered.

90
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:29,350
- Check with the university.
- I already did.

91
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:30,651
And it was a suicide.

92
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:33,187
Fisher, you're up.

93
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:35,489
Excuse me.

94
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:37,491
... At least three seriously.

95
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:39,827
A spokesman for Applied Holographics says

96
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:42,496
that the company will issue
a statement later today...

97
00:06:42,498 --> 00:06:44,798
... and that their main concern right now

98
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,268
is the safety of their staff.
The cause of the explosion...

99
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,770
Same device used yesterday
at the Elmwood apartments?

100
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:53,173
We'll talk about it later.

101
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:55,442
Don't stress. I'm finished.

102
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,546
Why weren't you and your father close?

103
00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:00,481
You're the detective.

104
00:07:00,483 --> 00:07:02,816
Detect.

105
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:08,889
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

106
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:20,568
What are you doing?

107
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,469
- Kicking you out.
- This is my house.

108
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,905
Not after I sue you for academic sabotage.

109
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:33,547
It's not your room anymore.

110
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:36,750
Can I get you anything?

111
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:39,219
A cold drink? Restraining order?

112
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:43,657
I'm locked out of the
university's computer system.

113
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,292
Yes, you're on academic suspension,

114
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:47,227
so Hardwyck revoked your account.

115
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:50,230
You know it wasn't me.
Maybe it was that horny T.A.

116
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:52,766
you screwed for an "A." He seemed
threatened by how smart you are.

117
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:55,502
Okay, I know you don't get
relationships, like, at all,

118
00:07:55,504 --> 00:07:57,638
but I don't need to
screw anyone for an "A."

119
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,873
Maybe not, but it wouldn't hurt your G.P.A.

120
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,675
if you did Hardwyck once or twice.

121
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:05,579
Look, I'm not striking the right tone here.

122
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:07,348
I need to use your laptop.

123
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,017
What? Are you... what?

124
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:15,556
No. No way.

125
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:17,524
You probably didn't hear,

126
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:20,260
but someone close to me died today.

127
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:22,296
What? Who?

128
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:24,565
Doesn't matter. But I want
to look at the police files,

129
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:26,433
and the only way to access them

130
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:27,868
is with an exploit I wrote last semester.

131
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,371
- The face recognition one?
- No, a back door probe.

132
00:08:30,373 --> 00:08:32,339
It's behind the university's firewall.

133
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:34,842
Okay, you want to use my laptop

134
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:36,810
to hack into the L.A.P.D.'s data server?

135
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:37,845
Yes.

136
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:41,315
Well, that's... help me,

137
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:43,651
what is the word I'm looking for? Illegal.

138
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:46,286
So that's a no on the laptop?

139
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:50,357
You would have a better chance
breaking into Hardwyck's office

140
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:53,360
and using his computer than borrowing mine.

141
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:55,329
Okay.

142
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:59,299
I'm pretty sure I was kidding.

143
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:00,467
No?

144
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:17,484
Good night, Vanessa.

145
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:19,386
Good night, professor.

146
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,429
Worn-down keys.

147
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:15,142
Stay where you are.

148
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:20,748
You guys are a little over-dressed

149
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,150
for campus security, don't you think?

150
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:39,700
Don't I at least get to make a phone call?

151
00:10:39,702 --> 00:10:41,935
To whom? Everyone you know

152
00:10:41,937 --> 00:10:44,404
is either dead or hates you.

153
00:10:44,406 --> 00:10:46,540
I could call a lawyer.

154
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,575
Lawyers aren't really my thing.

155
00:10:48,577 --> 00:10:50,644
Tell me about your father.

156
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:51,912
Why did he kill himself?

157
00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:53,680
He didn't. And he wasn't my father.

158
00:10:53,682 --> 00:10:55,482
I know,

159
00:10:55,484 --> 00:10:57,084
but I don't know what else to call him.

160
00:10:57,086 --> 00:11:00,521
My real father parked me
with him when I was eight.

161
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:02,589
What do you know about your real father?

162
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:04,825
- Nothing.
- Not true.

163
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:07,127
I know he didn't want
a kid. Does that count?

164
00:11:08,062 --> 00:11:10,497
Why did your father place you with Ed?

165
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:11,899
Place me?

166
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:13,500
I wasn't placed. When my mother died,

167
00:11:13,502 --> 00:11:15,469
daddy saw no benefit in me.

168
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:17,538
We had no family. He and Ed were friends.

169
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,740
Ed agreed to take me in. I
wasn't placed. I was abandoned.

170
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:21,842
But Ed never formally adopted you.

171
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:24,044
- That was something neither he nor I wanted.
- Why not?

172
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:27,514
Because it would have implied a
closeness that didn't exist. Where am I?

173
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:30,217
Is that why you didn't feel
anything when you saw him dead?

174
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:32,019
How do you know that?

175
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:34,822
I have access to certain police records.

176
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:37,491
Why didn't you feel
anything when you saw Ed?

177
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,694
You wouldn't understand.

178
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:43,497
Try me. I'm a very understanding person.

179
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:45,232
You can ask anyone.

180
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:48,836
How long have I been in this room?

181
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:50,637
- Answer my question.
- I'm trying to.

182
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,473
- How long have I been in this room?
- Guess.

183
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,010
- An hour.
- One minute.

184
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:01,148
You really don't know, do you?

185
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,683
I have this condition.

186
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:04,818
It's called "temporal dysplasia."

187
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
I have no time perception.

188
00:12:06,822 --> 00:12:09,623
I've read about the condition.
I thought it was made up.

189
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:12,526
I wish, 'cause then you can
unmake it up. It really sucks.

190
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,595
I use memory, logic, and math

191
00:12:14,597 --> 00:12:16,096
to approximate a time difference,

192
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:18,498
but I don't know what time feels like.

193
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,834
- Memory, math, and logic?
- Tell me where I am.

194
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:22,603
- Downtown L.A.
- Fine.

195
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:23,904
You say I've been in
this room for one minute.

196
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:25,606
Let's work backwards. Try to follow.

197
00:12:25,608 --> 00:12:29,676
It's a 22-minute car trip
from Caltech to downtown.

198
00:12:29,678 --> 00:12:32,079
I didn't have to pee, and I wasn't hungry,

199
00:12:32,081 --> 00:12:35,015
so I know I wasn't in Hardwyck's
office for more than an hour.

200
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:37,584
The Uber ride to Caltech from my place

201
00:12:37,586 --> 00:12:39,720
is 44 minutes on average.

202
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:41,555
Let's add 10 minutes at
home with my roommate,

203
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:43,590
because that's what I
think I can tolerate of her.

204
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:46,159
It's 47 minutes from my
house to the police station.

205
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:48,161
And I know I spent 73
minutes viewing dead Ed

206
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:49,696
and talking with Detective Tight-Ass,

207
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:51,765
because I checked the
time. So, doing the math,

208
00:12:51,767 --> 00:12:53,567
that's four hours and eight minutes.

209
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:55,068
But that's just numbers.

210
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,537
I don't know what four hours
and eight minutes feels like.

211
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:59,139
I don't even know how
long I just spoke for.

212
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:00,641
46 seconds.

213
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:02,809
My time perception is spot on.

214
00:13:02,811 --> 00:13:04,778
The reason I didn't react

215
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,546
when I saw Ed in the morgue

216
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:09,182
is because the moment I saw him,

217
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:11,051
it was as if he had been dead forever.

218
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:13,654
The moment I saw him, the
knowledge of him being dead

219
00:13:13,656 --> 00:13:15,589
was instantly familiar.

220
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:17,591
That's temporal dysplasia.

221
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:18,992
May I go now?

222
00:13:18,994 --> 00:13:23,030
You have been on my radar a long time.

223
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:24,731
Really? Then why am I now

224
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:26,867
off your radar and in
your Chinese restaurant?

225
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:28,669
My name is Maggie Baptiste,

226
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:30,671
and I'm working on a
project that needs someone

227
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:32,606
with your particular aptitude.

228
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:34,875
There are projects that need
someone with temporal dysplasia?

229
00:13:34,877 --> 00:13:36,743
One. Mine.

230
00:13:36,745 --> 00:13:38,745
I represent a federal agency

231
00:13:38,747 --> 00:13:40,747
that's investigating a very serious crime.

232
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:42,950
- FBI?
- Don't waste your time guessing.

233
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:45,719
That's good, Maggie Baptiste,
because I'm already not interested.

234
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:48,055
This crime is extremely time-sensitive,

235
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:50,057
- life and death.
- I already have a crime to solve.

236
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:52,726
Don't get up. I'll show myself out.

237
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:56,663
Kirsten,

238
00:13:56,665 --> 00:13:58,665
you have two choices.

239
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,233
One... you come work with me.

240
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:02,369
At your unguessable agency?

241
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:05,038
Two... I let you leave.

242
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,607
Your roommate just kicked you out,

243
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:09,176
so you have nowhere to live,

244
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:10,811
and you're on academic suspension,

245
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:13,013
so your doctoral plans are officially crap.

246
00:14:13,015 --> 00:14:15,949
And the only person who may
or may not have cared about you

247
00:14:15,951 --> 00:14:17,985
may or may not have killed himself,

248
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:19,953
you have no money and nowhere to go.

249
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:22,889
I know a horny T.A.

250
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:24,891
I could swap sex with for a place to stay.

251
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:27,294
I know that's not who
you are, and so do you.

252
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:30,764
Someone with temporal dysplasia

253
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:32,833
can work at your unguessable agency?

254
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:34,768
Let's find out.

255
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,426
Welcome to the Stitchers program.

256
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,767
What is that?

257
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:43,870
We call it the fish tank.

258
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:46,840
Is that because it looks like a fish tank?

259
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:49,142
I hope you people are
smarter than you are creative.

260
00:15:49,144 --> 00:15:51,745
I thought we were gonna wait
till she had her psych evaluation.

261
00:15:51,747 --> 00:15:53,980
There's no time. Interview
her if you feel the need,

262
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:56,383
- but I want her prepped in 20.
- Prepped for what?

263
00:15:56,385 --> 00:16:00,720
What's your problem that makes it
that you don't have any friends?

264
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:02,489
Why do you smell like meat?

265
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:04,357
I had beef fry for breakfast.

266
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:06,760
Beef fry? Is that a quantum computer?

267
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:08,228
It's like bacon, but made with beef.

268
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,097
- What are you, Muslim?
- No, I'm an atheist.

269
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,432
- Atheists don't eat pig?
- Not if it makes their grandmother sad.

270
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:14,134
- She Muslim?
- Jew-ish.

271
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:16,136
You gonna stalk her on
koshermatchmaker.com?

272
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:18,305
- I'm just asking.
- No, you're just jabbering.

273
00:16:18,307 --> 00:16:20,407
You ever been diagnosed?
You may be clinical.

274
00:16:20,409 --> 00:16:22,742
You're like Gollum. You've been
living in your cave so long,

275
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:24,377
you've forgotten how to talk
to the rest of us hobbits.

276
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:26,513
A simple Tolkien reference, and
I'm supposed to be impressed?

277
00:16:26,515 --> 00:16:29,516
Name all the actors who
played Doctor Who since 1963,

278
00:16:29,518 --> 00:16:31,518
and maybe you'll get a reaction out of me.

279
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,436
I'm the smartest person in my program.

280
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:35,217
Oh, so in your little
circle you're the smartest?

281
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:37,958
- So what does that make you? Queen of the Estupidos  ?
- You're quite the tool.

282
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,427
Thanks for making my point for me.

283
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:43,263
Okay, that concludes our interview.

284
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:45,398
Has anyone actually explained
to you what we do here?

285
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:53,440
This is the second corpse I've seen today.

286
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:56,209
Probably not your fault. Probably.

287
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:57,944
What did he die of?

288
00:16:57,946 --> 00:17:00,847
He died of explosion...
explosive concussion,

289
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:02,916
if you want to get all
technical, and I know you do.

290
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:04,784
- Who is he?
- You heard about the two bombs...

291
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:06,820
one yesterday and one from today?

292
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:09,289
This gent's our bomber... Peter Brandt.

293
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,291
28 years old, recently graduated

294
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:14,060
from the chemical engineering
program at U.C. Santa Monica

295
00:17:14,062 --> 00:17:17,130
with a master's in... wait for it...

296
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:19,966
energetic molecular studies. Explosives.

297
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:21,868
Why is he here? Are you guys coroners?

298
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,870
No, he's here to share
his memories with us.

299
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:25,372
But he's dead.

300
00:17:25,374 --> 00:17:27,274
Fun fact... after death,

301
00:17:27,276 --> 00:17:29,342
consciousness lingers for 30 seconds.

302
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:32,512
After 10 minutes, the
brain starts to degrade.

303
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:35,148
If we get a sample in here fast
enough, we can start a protocol

304
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,184
that will slow down further
deterioration for days.

305
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:39,819
- Sample? You mean corpse?
- Tomato, to-mah-to.

306
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:41,821
You're getting this guy's
dead, degrading brain

307
00:17:41,823 --> 00:17:43,290
to talk to you? How?

308
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:46,560
By inserting a living
consciousness into those memories.

309
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:47,994
We call it "stitching."

310
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:49,963
- That's impossible.
- Is that so,

311
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:52,999
Dr. I've-never-studied-
neuroscience-unlike-Cameron?

312
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:55,835
The brain is a bioelectrical device,

313
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:57,237
emphasis on "electrical."

314
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:58,838
Even after death, the wiring,

315
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,907
the synapses... they're
all still in there...

316
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:02,509
For a while anyways.

317
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:04,377
And that means, so are the memories.

318
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:07,113
But it takes a living consciousness
to access and interpret them.

319
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:08,982
And that's where you come in.

320
00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:11,384
You want to insert my consciousness
into this guy's dead brain?

321
00:18:11,386 --> 00:18:13,486
It sounds icky when you put it like that.

322
00:18:13,488 --> 00:18:15,989
- Has anyone ever done this before?
- Gone in? One person.

323
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:17,557
Her name's Marta. She's
no longer with the program.

324
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,125
Why not?

325
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:21,995
She couldn't handle it.

326
00:18:21,997 --> 00:18:24,164
So what do you want me to do
once I'm inside his memories?

327
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:26,166
We think yesterday's bomb was an accident.

328
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:28,235
Brandt blew up his
apartment while prepping it.

329
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:30,136
The second bomb, the
one from this morning...

330
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:32,005
that one took out a high-tech
firm in Santa Monica.

331
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:35,041
If Brandt died yesterday, how
did he set off a bomb today?

332
00:18:35,043 --> 00:18:36,910
That, Sparky, is the question.

333
00:18:36,912 --> 00:18:39,045
We traced some shady Bitcoin
transactions Brandt made.

334
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:41,648
Past month, he purchased
enough explosives, timers,

335
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,184
circuit boards, pressure
switches to make four bombs.

336
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:46,519
And you think he planted the
other bombs before he died?

337
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:48,255
Well, that's the nightmare scenario.

338
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:50,190
The bomb that took out
Brandt's apartment downtown...

339
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,891
that was just big enough for one device.

340
00:18:51,893 --> 00:18:53,326
That means there are two
devices unaccounted for.

341
00:18:53,328 --> 00:18:55,195
We need you to go back into Brandt's memory

342
00:18:55,197 --> 00:18:56,997
and find out where those
other two bombs are.

343
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,099
There are a whack of lives at stake.

344
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:00,967
- This really works?
- Mm-hmm.

345
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:02,102
Show me.

346
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:03,436
All right.

347
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:05,939
Let's get those clothes
off you and get busy.

348
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:08,975
When you're inside someone else's memory,

349
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,577
your mind projects an image of yourself

350
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,912
as if you were actually there.

351
00:19:12,914 --> 00:19:15,515
Dressed like this?

352
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:18,485
Yep. That material is
a mesh polyester fiber

353
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:20,987
coated in zinc-blackened
nickel over copper.

354
00:19:20,989 --> 00:19:23,189
Makes for a better connection

355
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:25,058
between your skin and our sensors.

356
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,926
- Whose idea was that?
- That would be me.

357
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:28,428
This is Linus. He handles

358
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,164
bioelectrical engineering
and communications.

359
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:33,033
Originally you were supposed
to be completely naked,

360
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:35,135
but there was some
pushback, so we compromised.

361
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:37,304
- By dressing me up as Catwoman?
- Oh, it's cool.

362
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:39,039
We're men of science.

363
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,573
Comm links.

364
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:42,475
We'll be able to talk to
each other through these.

365
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:44,678
I'll be driving Brandt's memory for you,

366
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
but I'll be driving blindfolded,
so you gotta lead me.

367
00:19:46,682 --> 00:19:48,948
How do I choose which memory to go to?

368
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,583
When we get a new sample,

369
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:52,385
the first thing we do
is map their memories.

370
00:19:52,387 --> 00:19:54,454
Some have incredibly
strong synaptic connections,

371
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:56,256
which means those are
more emotionally charged.

372
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:58,258
Those memories will pull you like a magnet.

373
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,194
Oh, this is Ayo. She's here to
make sure you don't get dead.

374
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:03,296
Nice.

375
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:06,966
Kirsten, are you ready?

376
00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:08,702
Let's find out.

377
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:15,108
Okay, Stretch, into the drink.

378
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:18,244
Stations, everyone.

379
00:20:19,413 --> 00:20:21,414
Keep your feet in contact with the pads.

380
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,616
- Why?
- Anchor points. You'll need them.

381
00:20:23,618 --> 00:20:25,452
- For what?
- You'll see.

382
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:27,987
Lights to 20%, please.

383
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,458
Okay, everyone, the
mission clock is running.

384
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,061
Captain's log, Stardate 2015.

385
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:37,030
- Seriously?
- Look, I don't tell you

386
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:39,165
how to be an emotionally vacant,
relationshiply void young woman;

387
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,167
you don't tell me how to run my lab.

388
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,503
- Fair enough.
- Stardate...

389
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:45,505
you know what? Never mind.
Forget it. You ruined it.

390
00:20:45,507 --> 00:20:47,574
All right, I need a go,
no-go for stitch neurosync.

391
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:49,275
- Life-sci.
- Good to go.

392
00:20:49,277 --> 00:20:50,710
- Sub-bio.
- Go.

393
00:20:50,712 --> 00:20:53,146
- Engineering.
- All systems online. Go.

394
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:55,648
- Communications.
- Go for the stitch, mon capitaine !

395
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,052
- Medical.
- She's looking good. Go.

396
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:01,621
- Comm check. One-two, one-two.
- I hear you.

397
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:03,690
See those keyboards under your hand?

398
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:06,326
You're going to use those to
bounce yourself out of the memory.

399
00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:09,496
When the time comes, you're going
to type in your username "Kirsten,"

400
00:21:09,498 --> 00:21:11,131
followed by your exit pin code.

401
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:13,299
What's my pin code?

402
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:18,171
"iheartlinus," lowercase, no spaces.

403
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:20,473
- I can change that, right?
- Absolutely not.

404
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:22,475
Comm check complete. Okay, we are go.

405
00:21:22,477 --> 00:21:25,578
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

406
00:21:26,781 --> 00:21:28,715
You're on, princess.

407
00:21:28,717 --> 00:21:30,784
Close your eyes. Try to relax

408
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:33,386
and don't forget, whatever you
see in there, you're not alone.

409
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:35,555
I'm with you.

410
00:21:35,557 --> 00:21:37,056
Trust me.

411
00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:39,259
Aye-aye, mon capitaine.

412
00:21:39,261 --> 00:21:41,261
Stitch neurosync in three,

413
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:45,198
two, one.

414
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,500
Mark.

415
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,094
- Slow your breathing down.
- Where am I?

416
00:22:15,096 --> 00:22:17,163
In Brandt's apartment.
There must be some clue

417
00:22:17,165 --> 00:22:18,731
to where he planted those bombs.

418
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:21,701
I'm cold. I'm cold. I'm really cold.

419
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:24,537
- Ayo?
- Body temp is 98.6, steady.

420
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,207
You're not cold.

421
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:32,479
- She's going into shock.
- This is why we do psychological testing.

422
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:34,581
- Yes, that worked so well for Marta.
- I'm bouncing her.

423
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:36,649
We need to know where
the other two bombs are.

424
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:40,119
Kirsten, slow your breathing down.

425
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:42,188
Really try. Otherwise
we have to bounce you.

426
00:22:43,824 --> 00:22:46,159
I thought I had to do that.

427
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:49,729
But after that, you're gonna
have to make the bounce yourself.

428
00:22:49,731 --> 00:22:52,265
- And if I can't?
- We can still do it for you,

429
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:55,301
but your consciousness won't like
being yanked out when it's not ready.

430
00:22:55,303 --> 00:22:57,537
It leaves a mark, a bad one.

431
00:22:59,173 --> 00:23:01,174
Slow your breathing down.

432
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:10,450
- We should bounce her.
- Is that Linus?

433
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:11,918
Yeah, he thinks we should bounce you.

434
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Just tell him to shut the hell up.

435
00:23:13,922 --> 00:23:16,256
Hey, I think she likes you.

436
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:18,224
Fine, we won't bounce you as long as you

437
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:20,894
calm yourself down. Can you do that for me?

438
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:29,335
She's stabilizing.

439
00:23:29,337 --> 00:23:32,405
Hey, much better.

440
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:35,341
Much better.

441
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:48,955
Am I really still back in
the lab, in the fish tank?

442
00:23:48,957 --> 00:23:50,490
Yep.

443
00:23:53,394 --> 00:23:55,528
Dressed like Catwoman?

444
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,664
Without the cat ears and stilettos,

445
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,199
but for the most part, yeah.

446
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:02,936
I told you... time is my point.

447
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:05,405
You wouldn't understand.
This is my life's work.

448
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:06,906
I do understand.

449
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:08,775
Julie!

450
00:24:08,777 --> 00:24:10,543
Okay.

451
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:12,345
What do you want me to do?

452
00:24:12,347 --> 00:24:14,881
Take a walk around the
apartment. Check it out.

453
00:24:16,784 --> 00:24:18,551
And what am I looking for?

454
00:24:18,553 --> 00:24:21,287
Scraps of paper with addresses on them,

455
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:23,289
pictures of buildings or places...

456
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:27,994
something that's gotta tell us
where those other two bombs are.

457
00:24:30,432 --> 00:24:32,031
I hear something.

458
00:24:33,701 --> 00:24:35,401
Follow it.

459
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:43,443
Uh, there's a door, but I can't open it.

460
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:45,678
You're a consciousness
now, not physical matter.

461
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
You have to will it to open.

462
00:24:57,491 --> 00:24:59,425
I'm in.

463
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:43,569
Signal is failing. Signal is failing.

464
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:45,938
- Cameron.
- I see it.

465
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:49,642
I don't understand it, but I see it.

466
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:52,512
- What is happening?
- Her E.E.G. is off the chart.

467
00:25:52,514 --> 00:25:54,347
It's like her brain's
in freakin' overdrive.

468
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:56,482
This is it.

469
00:25:56,484 --> 00:25:58,718
- This is it.
- You made this?

470
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:02,455
You're gonna save so many lives.

471
00:26:03,424 --> 00:26:04,957
Julie Malarek.

472
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,959
- Linus.
- Checking.

473
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:10,096
- They're taking it from me.
- No, they can't.

474
00:26:10,098 --> 00:26:12,365
They did.

475
00:26:12,367 --> 00:26:16,536
They're stealing it from me,
and nobody is stopping them!

476
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,444
- Linus.
- Julie Malarek.

477
00:26:24,446 --> 00:26:26,779
She died three months ago, a
traffic accident of some kind.

478
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,584
- It's all your fault.
- She's gone, pal.

479
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:33,386
- Somebody help me.
- It's all your fault.

480
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:26,806
Oh, no.

481
00:27:30,544 --> 00:27:32,645
Whoa, come on.

482
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:47,426
Hey, are you okay, Rocky?

483
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:49,896
You were wrong. The
bomb in his apartment...

484
00:27:49,898 --> 00:27:52,031
it wasn't an accident.

485
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:55,434
My head's beginning to hurt.

486
00:27:55,436 --> 00:27:57,069
Her cerebral temp is rising.

487
00:27:57,071 --> 00:27:59,038
Brandt's memory is beginning to collapse.

488
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,140
- Sub-bio, boost the A.T.P.
- We're at maximum.

489
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:04,610
Not to alarm you, Princess, but
Brandt's brain is collapsing,

490
00:28:04,612 --> 00:28:07,113
which is a very bad thing.

491
00:28:07,115 --> 00:28:10,116
Yeah, I can see it happening.

492
00:28:10,118 --> 00:28:13,119
- You gotta bounce now.
- Cerebral temperature is 103.

493
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:15,121
Total memory collapse in 14 seconds.

494
00:28:15,123 --> 00:28:17,590
- First name.
- 10 seconds.

495
00:28:17,592 --> 00:28:20,026
And now your exit pin code.

496
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:23,095
iheartlinus.

497
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:25,164
- Yeah, you do.
- Make the bounce!

498
00:28:28,969 --> 00:28:31,637
Okay, just relax while
we take off the restrai...

499
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:34,075
- Okay, hold up.
- Cameron, that anomaly just shocked...

500
00:28:34,076 --> 00:28:34,947
Yeah, yeah, I saw it.

501
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:38,544
Kristen, are you okay?

502
00:28:45,185 --> 00:28:47,119
Blue door.

503
00:28:47,121 --> 00:28:48,955
Sepulveda.

504
00:28:57,264 --> 00:28:59,565
I'm so sorry,

505
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,234

How are you feeling?

518
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,813
Like I got hit by a bus.

519
00:29:47,815 --> 00:29:49,181
Fantastic. You hungry?

520
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:51,083
I made us some kale,
tarragon breakfast smoothies.

521
00:29:51,085 --> 00:29:53,586
- Whose bed did I just wake up in?
- Mine.

522
00:29:53,588 --> 00:29:55,688
- And where did you sleep?
- Right next to you.

523
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,157
- Ow!
- Ow!

524
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,260
- I was unconscious, you pig.
- Get over yourself.

525
00:30:01,262 --> 00:30:03,329
For the record, I slept
on top of the sheets.

526
00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:04,997
I was babysitting you to
make sure you were okay.

527
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:07,033
So how did I get into these pajamas?

528
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:09,635
Ayo from the lab changed you.
She helped bring you here.

529
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:13,039
I don't remember any of that.

530
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:15,708
Do you remember

531
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,910
anything from after the stitch,

532
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:20,179
like... kissing me?

533
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:21,347
I kissed you?

534
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:22,982
You don't have to say it like that.

535
00:30:22,984 --> 00:30:25,651
I don't know what happened.

536
00:30:25,653 --> 00:30:29,322
I was just very... affected

537
00:30:29,324 --> 00:30:31,023
by being in Brandt's memory.

538
00:30:31,025 --> 00:30:34,327
Yeah, apparently.

539
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:36,329
Well, if it makes you feel better,

540
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:39,632
- I don't feel like kissing you now.
- Mm-hmm, much better.

541
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:42,168
Drink your sludge and get dressed.

542
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,170
We're wanted back at the lab.

543
00:30:46,606 --> 00:30:48,708
Mm, it's good.

544
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,710
Good morning.

545
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:53,312
While the two of you were
having a little sleepover,

546
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:55,848
I decided to search all
the social media sites.

547
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,452
Julie Malarek and Peter Brandt met

548
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,252
while they were grad
students at U.C. Santa Monica.

549
00:31:00,254 --> 00:31:02,688
Now by all accounts,
they were a happy couple.

550
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,391
But then three months ago she
died when she got hit by a bus.

551
00:31:05,393 --> 00:31:07,793
I saw it happen. She walked
away from Peter upset.

552
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:10,830
She said something about someone
stealing something from her.

553
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:12,832
Julie majored in electrical engineering

554
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:15,234
with an emphasis on holography.

555
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:16,969
You guys see where I'm going with this?

556
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:18,904
Applied holographics. The second bomb.

557
00:31:18,906 --> 00:31:20,906
Bingo.

558
00:31:20,908 --> 00:31:23,209
That's the building she came
from right before she died.

559
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:25,144
She was furious, out of her mind.

560
00:31:25,146 --> 00:31:28,080
If Applied Holographics
stole Julie's research,

561
00:31:28,082 --> 00:31:30,816
maybe Brandt blamed them for her
death and was getting revenge.

562
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:32,318
There are two more bombs. Where are they?

563
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,353
Stitch me back into Brandt's
memory and I'll find them.

564
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:37,089
That's no longer an option. Brandt's
brain has hit its "best by" date.

565
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:38,791
Yeah, he's done.

566
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:46,799
Sepulveda, a blue door...

567
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:48,300
I saw both during the stitch.

568
00:31:48,302 --> 00:31:49,835
It meant something to Peter.

569
00:31:49,837 --> 00:31:51,437
What was the emotion?

570
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:54,106
I don't know, but it was strong.

571
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:56,842
I've had two teams searching
all of Sepulveda Boulevard

572
00:31:56,844 --> 00:31:59,378
since last night looking for
blue doors. So far... nothing.

573
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,280
Well, then they're doing it wrong.

574
00:32:01,282 --> 00:32:03,783
Sepulveda boulevard is 43 miles long.

575
00:32:03,785 --> 00:32:05,451
You think you can search faster?

576
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:08,821
Actually, I wouldn't mind
doing some field work.

577
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:11,824
The agency has people
who handle the field work.

578
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:14,727
Unsocialized nerds and girls
in cat suits need not apply.

579
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:16,262
Okay, I was just saying.

580
00:32:16,264 --> 00:32:18,831
Look, we don't even know
how accurate this memory is.

581
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:20,800
Brandt's brain was so
degraded and concussed,

582
00:32:20,802 --> 00:32:22,935
it could have been a mixture of
thoughts and ideas from anywhere...

583
00:32:22,937 --> 00:32:25,371
a book he read, a cartoon
he watched when he was five.

584
00:32:25,373 --> 00:32:28,974
No, the memory was real
and emotionally charged.

585
00:32:31,378 --> 00:32:33,412
I'll do it myself.

586
00:32:33,414 --> 00:32:35,848
- Kirsten.
- Told you.

587
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,217
Smartass.

588
00:32:41,755 --> 00:32:45,791
Kirsten, Kirsten.

589
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:48,994
The Stitchers program is
as clandestine as they come.

590
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:51,063
We don't stray outside our mandate, ever.

591
00:32:51,065 --> 00:32:53,432
If you get caught
someplace you don't belong,

592
00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:56,202
the agency will swoop in
and disappear all of us.

593
00:32:56,204 --> 00:32:58,771
And I'm too old to do a stint in Gitmo.

594
00:32:59,506 --> 00:33:01,507
I'm not.

595
00:33:05,412 --> 00:33:08,881
Still not a fan of psychological testing?

596
00:33:12,752 --> 00:33:14,753
Deal with this.

597
00:33:22,262 --> 00:33:24,497
Kirsten, wait.

598
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:26,899
We have to find that blue door.

599
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:28,968
Okay, you heard Maggie.
There's two teams on it already.

600
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,303
Yeah, two ineffectual teams.
There are two more bombs to find.

601
00:33:31,305 --> 00:33:32,938
I can do this so much faster.

602
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,941
Oh, come on, Cameron. You
asked me to trust you and I did.

603
00:33:35,943 --> 00:33:38,043
Now I'm asking you to trust me.

604
00:33:39,112 --> 00:33:41,814
Lives are at stake. You said so yourself.

605
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:45,551
All right, ace, what's your plan?

606
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:50,556
Good, you're here.

607
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:52,958
It's about time you
came back for your stuff.

608
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,227
I was just about to
burn it in the backyard.

609
00:33:55,229 --> 00:33:59,932
Oh my god, this is all part of
your delusional whatever, isn't it?

610
00:33:59,934 --> 00:34:02,902
Listen, I don't know you, but I know her.

611
00:34:02,904 --> 00:34:05,037
Get out of here before I tase both of you.

612
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,106
We work for a secret
government agency that hacks

613
00:34:07,108 --> 00:34:09,175
into the brains of corpses
and reads their memories.

614
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:10,876
You have no filter at all, do you?

615
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:12,378
You know that bomber on the news?

616
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,580
He died in an explosion,
and I read his memories.

617
00:34:14,582 --> 00:34:17,550
He's planted two more bombs, but the trained
monkeys at the agency can't find them.

618
00:34:17,552 --> 00:34:19,385
Trained monkeys? That's hurtful.

619
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:21,520
But I can find them, if you help me.

620
00:34:23,256 --> 00:34:24,557
You guys don't really hack

621
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:26,559
into dead people's brains
and read their memories.

622
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:29,161
Yeah.

623
00:34:29,163 --> 00:34:30,996
Look, we don't have a lot of time.

624
00:34:30,998 --> 00:34:32,403
I need to get into the
Caltech computer system.

625
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:33,571
I need to run an image search

626
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,306
for buildings on
Sepulveda with a blue door.

627
00:34:35,308 --> 00:34:37,642
Do you know how long Sepulveda is?

628
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:40,278
Apparently 43 miles.

629
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,047
But you know that face
recognition exploit I wrote?

630
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:45,082
If I change four lines of
code, I can make it search

631
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,884
for blue doors instead of faces.

632
00:34:46,886 --> 00:34:49,553
You still think I'm the queen of Estupidos?

633
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,890
- You said that?
- I haven't seen either of you

634
00:34:52,892 --> 00:34:56,861
do anything smart yet, so... yeah.

635
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,631
Please be seated.

636
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,568
Damn it.

637
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,271
- Okay, are you sure you rewrote the code correctly?
- Yes.

638
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,139
You ran it three times. There's no building

639
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,875
with a blue door on Sepulveda Boulevard.

640
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:16,247
There has to be. I saw it.
It was in Brandt's memory.

641
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:18,182
What if the blue door in Brandt's memory

642
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:20,684
was a visual placeholder
for non-visual information?

643
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,788
Double major in data retrieval systems.

644
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,056
May I?

645
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,729
Let's try Occam's razor.

646
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:34,064
The simplest solution
is most often correct.

647
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:36,000
So let's try a simple Boolean search...

648
00:35:36,002 --> 00:35:38,002
"blue door"

649
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:40,638
plus "Sepulveda."

650
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:47,144
What's that picture?

651
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,550
- It's all your fault.
- She's gone, pal.

652
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:54,985
- Help me.
- It's all your fault!

653
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:59,623
"Jane Pica, Dean of the electrical
engineering program at U.C. Santa Monica

654
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,959
- and president of Blue Door Consulting... "
- On Sepulveda Boulevard.

655
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:03,661
"... Announcing the purchase

656
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:05,729
of her holographic projection technology

657
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,631
by Applied Holographics."

658
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:11,035
Pica's the one who sold Julie's
research to Applied Holographics.

659
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:12,836
And with the school's tech transfer rules,

660
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,972
there's nothing Julie or
Peter could do to stop her.

661
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:17,308
True, but Peter could get revenge.

662
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,643
Where does this Jane Pica live?

663
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,580
At 3:30. Can you do that?

664
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,049
There she is.

665
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:27,151
I'm still not convinced
this is a good idea.

666
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:28,819
I am.

667
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,423
For the love of Zod.

668
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:34,925
Excuse me.

669
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:37,261
- Jane Pica?
- Yeah.

670
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:43,834
Someone call 911.

671
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,373
- You okay?
- Yeah.

672
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,175
Please tell me there
wasn't anyone in there.

673
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:52,676
No, nobody.

674
00:36:52,678 --> 00:36:55,713
There was a skinny guy at
Julie Malarek's funeral,

675
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:57,948
short and thinning hair. We need a name.

676
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,351
- My house.
- A word of advice...

677
00:37:00,353 --> 00:37:02,119
next time you steal someone's technology,

678
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:04,154
make sure their boyfriend
wasn't a bomb-making genius.

679
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:07,391
- What are you talking about?
- You stole Julie Malarek's research and sold it.

680
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:09,326
- You killed her.
- That wasn't my fault.

681
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:12,096
Yeah, tell that to your
unique fixer-upper here.

682
00:37:12,098 --> 00:37:14,665
The skinny guy at the funeral.

683
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,676
Fred. Fred Castellano.

684
00:37:17,677 --> 00:37:18,846
Where can we find him?

685
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,905
U.C. Santa Monica, the science building.

686
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,707
Who are you people?

687
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,175
Friends of Julie.

688
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,182
So Castellano funnels
Julie's research to Pica,

689
00:37:32,184 --> 00:37:34,818
who sells it to applied
holographics for a small fortune.

690
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,055
Pica got rich, Castellano got a
finder's fee, and Julie got screwed.

691
00:37:38,057 --> 00:37:39,790
And Brandt gets revenge.

692
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:41,358
We've got to clear this building.

693
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,427
If a bomb goes off in here,
it's gonna be a disaster.

694
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:46,764
Check out the testicles on Cameron.

695
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,265
Thank you.

696
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:50,300
Fred Castellano.

697
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,803
Room 230.

698
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:54,204
Wait.

699
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,113
Forget Castellano. The
bomb's in the basement.

700
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,154
It's down here.

701
00:38:10,156 --> 00:38:12,156
Help! Help!

702
00:38:12,158 --> 00:38:13,957
Help!

703
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:19,263
Holy big freakin' bomb, Batman.

704
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,745
- Thank god.
- We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

705
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:36,313
No!

706
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,349
It's a mercury tumbler switch.

707
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:41,985
If it moves even a little,

708
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,188
it will detonate the bomb.

709
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,090
Okay, this officially sucks.

710
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:48,092
I've been up for two days,

711
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:49,893
staying so still.

712
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:53,063
I can't do this anymore.

713
00:38:53,065 --> 00:38:56,033
Sure you can. We're gonna help you.

714
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:58,869
I don't deserve to live. I'm sorry.

715
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:00,504
Julie, I'm so sorry.

716
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,310
The man with the motion-sensitive
detonator is sobbing.

717
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:08,512
- Get out of here, Cameron.
- Sorry, cupcake,

718
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:10,114
not without you.

719
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,884
- Please.
- Cameron, you're smart.

720
00:39:13,886 --> 00:39:15,219
You can figure out how do defuse this.

721
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:16,887
I harvest the memories of the dead.

722
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:19,289
This requires a completely
different skill set.

723
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,894
In the stitch, you said you heard

724
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:26,463
cell phone tones?

725
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:27,831
Yes.

726
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:30,367
Yes, five... five of them.

727
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:33,203
- What are you doing?
- Being someone with temporal dysplasia.

728
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,516
Listen.

729
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,792
- Cell phone.
- Here.

730
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,930
Okay.

731
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:03,967
It's 5-8-5-4-3.

732
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,036
Of course.

733
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,239
No!

734
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,283
Oh.

735
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,393
It spelled "Julie."

736
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,072
Police!

737
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,609
Easy, Detective.

738
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,911
We're the good guys.

739
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:54,851
I was... there was... I
was holding the thing...

740
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:58,922
Looks like it's all clear.

741
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:01,558
Okay, Miss Clark, what the
hell really happened in there?

742
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,393
I told you. We were studying.

743
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:05,262
We heard a noise in the
basement and we checked it out.

744
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:07,864
- And then defused a bomb?
- It's actually not that hard to do

745
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,000
- once you figure out a few ba...
- Shut up.

746
00:41:10,002 --> 00:41:12,603
Fine, you two want to play?

747
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:14,438
That's fine. We'll play.

748
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,107
- You're under arrest.
- No, they're not.

749
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,944
N.S.A.?

750
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:22,879
Ish.

751
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,217
We did everything we were supposed to do.

752
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:29,586
We found the bombs, saved
who knows how many people?

753
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31,655
The agency probably
thinks we're superstars.

754
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:34,558
The agency is considering yanking
our funding because of you two.

755
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,426
Maybe that's not such a bad idea.

756
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:38,428
Unfortunately for that point of view,

757
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,964
I have convinced them to
give us another chance.

758
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,899
I assured them that this is a rookie error

759
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:45,535
and from now on we're going
to stick to our mandate...

760
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:48,238
inside work only, very inside.

761
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,473
Am I clear?

762
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:51,942
Clear?

763
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:54,278
I didn't want to be
here in the first place.

764
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,917
What, I suppose you want me to... ?

765
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:02,552
Fine.

766
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,124
Wait. Kirsten.

767
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:09,426
The thing about being stitched...

768
00:42:09,428 --> 00:42:12,663
it made me feel things
I've never felt before.

769
00:42:12,665 --> 00:42:15,299
When I was a little girl, I had to learn

770
00:42:15,301 --> 00:42:18,702
how to identify emotions by
flash cards of human faces.

771
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:21,571
But this time I felt
them, and they were real.

772
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:23,607
Now I know what grief feels like.

773
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:25,609
Now I know what anger feels like.

774
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:29,112
I might even know what love feels like.

775
00:42:29,114 --> 00:42:32,049
I'm not a fan. I'm out.

776
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:33,750
That's too bad. We've been asked

777
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,619
to look into the death
of a research scientist,

778
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:38,955
and we've only got 48 hours
before his memories collapse.

779
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:41,425
He and his partner developed
the Stitchers technology.

780
00:42:41,427 --> 00:42:43,260
His name was Ed Clark.

781
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:49,232
The agency isn't convinced
that he killed himself.

782
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,034
I know he didn't.

783
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:56,473
Who was his partner?

784
00:42:56,475 --> 00:42:58,575
Dr. Daniel Stinger.

785
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,148
Your father.

786
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:08,018
I'm in.
