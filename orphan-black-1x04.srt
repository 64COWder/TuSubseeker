1
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:06,350
I saw a girl kill herself.

2
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:08,196
And she looked exactly like me.

3
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:10,378
Elizabeth Childs. To find out who she is

4
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:11,636
or to rob the rest of her shit?

5
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:13,709
Beth is a cop. I'm a cop.

6
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:15,294
Who the hell is Maggie Chen?

7
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:16,868
That's the woman Beth shot.

8
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,285
The only way you will
regain custody of Kira

9
00:00:19,273 --> 00:00:22,435
- is to show me you can be still.
- We're clones.

10
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:24,620
We're someone's experiment
and they're killing us off!

11
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:25,863
The German's dead.

12
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:27,717
Someone shot her right in front of me!

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,524
You need to get rid of the body.

14
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:31,104
Beth's partner found the German...

15
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:32,230
or at least part of her.

16
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,232
If the body matches me, the cops will see

17
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:36,234
a mugshot of somebody who looks like Beth,

18
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:38,584
only it's yours truly and I'm
already supposed to be dead.

19
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:40,441
Beth had a substantial sum,

20
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,677
a fund she used to buy

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,038
information we couldn't get officially.

22
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:44,844
The fund was how I could contribute.

23
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:46,486
The killer contacted Art.

24
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:48,308
He's already at the scene
where Katja was shot.

25
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:49,884
That was in the sniper's nest.

26
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:52,508
We got a live one. Phone
calls, leaving clues.

27
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:54,729
"I am fearfully and wonderfully made."

28
00:00:55,943 --> 00:00:57,476
I'm okay! Go after him, go!

29
00:00:57,478 --> 00:00:58,677
Oh!

30
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,146
I'm not Beth!

31
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:18,164
"I'm not Beth".

32
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:28,440
"I'm not Beth".

33
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:38,484
"I'm not Beth".

34
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:41,020
"I'm not Beth".

35
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:32,504
Shh.

36

37
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:38,806
Why would one of us be killing us?

38
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:39,976
What is wrong with her?

39
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:42,472
Bad breath. Batshit crazy.

40
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:45,081
Does she know about me, about my kids?

41
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,057
How do you know you didn't just

42
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:47,346
bring her right to my doorstep?

43
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:49,982
Because she's impaled with
rebar and I wouldn't do that.

44
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:51,300
I have been living this nightmare

45
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:52,764
much longer than you have, Sarah.

46
00:03:52,776 --> 00:03:54,766
I explained I have a family to protect.

47
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:55,961
I do what I can.

48
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,626
Right, you provide financially.

49
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,849
Yeah, so you wanted that
money Beth was holding.

50
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:03,557
Your self defense fund.

51
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,291
You're right, I was going to steal it

52
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:08,819
and run, but I can't do that,

53
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,583
because I have a family, too, Alison,

54
00:04:10,703 --> 00:04:11,784
my daughter.

55
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:13,973
Your daughter?

56
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:15,808
Yeah. Her name's Kira

57
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,403
and I'm meant to be seeing her today,

58
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:20,094
but there's this killer up my arse, so.

59
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,325
Wait, is she your biological child

60
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:23,839
or adopted, like mine?

61
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,951
Mine. Why?

62
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:30,122
Don't you think you should've
told us about that before?

63
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:31,623
Why would I do that?

64
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,007
I'm telling you now because we have to

65
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,644
deal with this, yeah?

66
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,953
Beth was on this killer's
hit list and, now, I am.

67
00:04:36,997 --> 00:04:39,524
Yeah? What am I supposed to do about it?

68
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,237
How can I help?

69
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:47,072
Be available.

70
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:49,991
I may need you, somehow.

71
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:59,000
Wow, rich, man.

72
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:00,915
This looks like a new blade inset

73
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:02,911
in a much older handle,

74
00:05:02,923 --> 00:05:06,183
so the fish is a bitch,
semiotically speaking,

75
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:09,361
like a universal wayback
symbol of fecundity.

76
00:05:09,363 --> 00:05:12,164
But these wings, though, they're...

77
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,160
Seriously, what is she on about?

78
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,999
Quiet. She's just weird.

79
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,485
Sorry. Sorry sorry sorry.

80
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:19,190
Okay, going on a tangent there.

81
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,667
If she's not dead,

82
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,208
we need to find her,
find out what she knows.

83
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,552
Are you mad?

84
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,947
She's a homicidal maniac.

85
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,862
Yeah, but we need to find
out who she is, Sarah.

86
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:29,388
She's... she's she found us.

87
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,348
She's got answers.

88
00:05:30,383 --> 00:05:31,634
The only way I'm going to do that is

89
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,055
go back to being a cop.

90
00:05:33,175 --> 00:05:33,923
No.

91
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,438
No way. You're not
going back to being Beth.

92
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,385
Impersonating a dead officer,

93
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:40,142
that's like a whole new crime.

94
00:05:40,144 --> 00:05:42,293
I think I'm safest with the
cops, to be honest with you.

95
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,613
Did that actually just
come out of your mouth?

96
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,615
Look, Art's already looking for the killer.

97
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:48,108
I shadow him as Beth,

98
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,941
I let them figure out
what's happened to her,

99
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,574
and then, when I find that out,

100
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:52,969
I can jump off and deal.

101
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:53,914
"Deal"?

102
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:56,258
I'm beginning to realize crazy's genetic.

103
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,505
Well, yeah, bad brain chemistry

104
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,094
can be genetic,

105
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,348
but environment...
that's individual, right?

106
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:04,549
I mean, that's the whole

107
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,356
nature/nurture question right there.

108
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:08,722
Okay, let's talk nature.

109
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:10,468
Out of 9, so far,

110
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:12,508
one's a psycho who killed 4 others,

111
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:13,840
one committed suicide,

112
00:06:13,865 --> 00:06:15,479
one is a bloody soccer mum,

113
00:06:15,744 --> 00:06:17,482
and then, there's you.

114
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:19,853
My crazy sister is sane, by comparison.

115
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:21,161
Thanks, Fe.

116
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:22,965
I think this might help us figure out

117
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:25,672
where she's coming from,
so I'll look into it.

118
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:29,723
Ah, police business.

119
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:32,260
- Art's got a lead.
- Okay.

120
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:34,217
Hey, you didn't show this to Alison,

121
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:35,195
by any chance, did you?

122
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,621
Are you joking? She'd crap her lululemons.

123
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:40,931
I've got Alison on standby.

124
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:45,898
Make sure Gemma wears her seatbelt!

125
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:47,293
You're sending the kids to your parents

126
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:48,457
on a school morning.

127
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,240
Well, they're staying the night.

128
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:52,267
That's not an answer.

129
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:54,414
Well, you didn't pose it as
a question, did you, Donnie?

130
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:56,109
Okay. Why?

131
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:57,839
Why did you cancel all their activities?

132
00:06:57,841 --> 00:07:00,183
I just wanted some time to myself.

133
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:03,073
You have your usual Thursday-night
drinks with clients, right?

134
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:03,779
Yes.

135
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:04,799
So I'll see you when you come

136
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,671
crashing in at 3:00 am, normal time.

137
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:09,536
I don't crash in.

138
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:10,794
One time.

139
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,839
Oh, crap.

140
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:33,943
Sorry.

141
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:35,664
I'm jumpy, too.

142
00:07:36,427 --> 00:07:37,813
How's your head?

143
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:39,393
Probably about the same as yours.

144
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:42,462
It's a good day to be alive, Beth.

145
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:43,712
My kids thank you.

146
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:45,499
Hell, even my ex thanks you.

147
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:46,482
Yeah, don't mention it.

148
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:48,221
I didn't. They did it.

149
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:50,011
I got a present for you.

150
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:52,039
Our killer made a pit-stop.

151
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,445
That's his bike.

152
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:54,966
They got him?

153
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,573
No, but we got a witness.

154
00:07:57,624 --> 00:08:00,047
Just follow the bloody brick road.

155
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,542
Hey, there he is, our walking wounded.

156
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,896
You all good, Art?

157
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,211
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Hey, glad you're okay.

158
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:11,106
We're going to get this
guy. Don't worry, all right?

159
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:12,846
So your guy wore gloves. No prints.

160
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:14,360
But he's not exactly covering his tracks.

161
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:15,562
Go take a look.

162
00:08:23,664 --> 00:08:25,120
Self-surgery.

163
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:28,375
Guy's what, military?

164
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,027
Looks like it's gotta hurt.

165
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,616
Oh, the witness is ready.

166
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:33,613
Art, you want to take him?

167
00:08:33,615 --> 00:08:34,638
No.

168
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:36,465
Come on.

169
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,120
I slept through the whole thing.

170
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,689
I can't believe it.

171
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:44,416
Trevor came into my room.

172
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:45,749
It was dark

173
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,832
and he was all wet

174
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:50,163
with blood.

175
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:57,724
He said it was an angry angel.

176
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:04,856
Hey, Trevor.

177
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:07,960
Can you tell me what the
angry angel looked like?

178
00:09:16,457 --> 00:09:19,435
The person in your bathroom was a woman?

179
00:09:20,386 --> 00:09:22,000
Is that possible?

180
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:28,238
Let me talk to him.

181
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,103
Yeah, sure.

182
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,894
It's okay, darling.

183
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:38,658
I'm not her.

184
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,223
She said you would come.

185
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,751
Pick a color.

186
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:47,762
Red.

187
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,062
That one.

188
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:58,131
Wait wait wait. Let me see that.

189
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:04,530
- Can I keep this?
- Yes.

190
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,351
What you got there?

191
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:09,176
Souvenir.

192
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:15,861
What the hell?

193
00:10:16,469 --> 00:10:17,851
Hey, can you bag this?

194
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:28,328
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

195
00:10:34,956 --> 00:10:39,097
Yes, once again, 8:00, before her bedtime.

196
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:40,841
Is that my mum?

197
00:10:40,856 --> 00:10:41,908
No, hon.

198
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,743
Did you just tell her it wasn't me?

199
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:45,461
Sarah, why are you calling?

200
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:48,045
If you don't show, after all
this anticipation, I will...

201
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,616
Just making sure we're still on.

202
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:51,273
Well, we are, at this end.

203
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:53,186
Yeah, I'll be there.

204
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:55,288
Can I talk to her?

205
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,857
You can talk to her tonight.

206
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:01,995
If you let her down,

207
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,298
that's it, I won't let you see her again.

208
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:08,140
I said I'll be there.

209
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,036
So you all have copies
of the fortune teller.

210
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,894
Eyewitness says we got it wrong...

211
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:28,905
Jane Doe's killer is
female, about Beth's size.

212
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:30,413
As for the Jane Doe,

213
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:32,366
it isn't easy, reconstructing a skull

214
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:34,468
that's gone through a gravel crusher, but,

215
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:36,620
we do have cause of death.

216
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,335
This hole, .223-caliber.

217
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:42,382
So, we have a long-range,
high-powered weapon.

218
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,485
Name me one homicide

219
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:46,658
ever pinned on a female sniper.

220
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:47,958
How's that profile?

221
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:50,495
Female killers tend to suffer
from chronic detachment.

222
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:52,149
Isolation breeds sociopaths.

223
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:55,184
This psalm, "fearfully
and wonderfully made"...

224
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:57,192
she's a religious fanatic.

225
00:11:57,312 --> 00:11:59,576
The stick figures, the doll's head,

226
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:00,770
the fortune teller...

227
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,585
early-childhood development issues?

228
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:03,692
Could be extreme abuse.

229
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,257
Yes, but he's also careful, in her way.

230
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,422
No prints on any of this, so far.

231
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,605
And the DNA evidence?

232
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:11,019
On rush, but we're still a week away

233
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:12,651
from knowing if they match anyone on file.

234
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:14,486
Nothing on Jane Doe's prints?

235
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:16,049
Her hand didn't give us a match?

236
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:19,321
No. No, they did not.

237
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:20,372
Look, the bottom line is

238
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:21,880
we are chasing a calculated

239
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:23,951
female killer who loves playing games.

240
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:27,617
Like these fortune tellers.

241
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:28,386
Angie.

242
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:30,576
Certain choices give certain answers.

243
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:32,653
Every choice is a different death.

244
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:34,936
Could be threats, could be existing kills.

245
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:36,144
They might mean something,

246
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,546
when combined with the numbers.

247
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:38,503
Childs?

248
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,904
Childs.

249
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:41,698
Call for you.

250
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:46,786
Detective Childs.

251
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,494
No, you're not.

252
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:51,210
Beth is dead, isn't she?

253
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,480
What do you want from me?

254
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:54,889
You could've killed me, but here we are.

255
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,047
You didn't feel it?

256
00:12:57,523 --> 00:12:58,373
What?

257
00:12:58,493 --> 00:13:00,083
We have a connection.

258
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:03,292
Uh, you mean when I stuck

259
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:04,856
that piece of rebar in your liver?

260
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:05,963
How's that going?

261
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:08,403
I need to know who you are.

262
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:10,074
Let's meet again.

263
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:13,046
I never got your name.

264
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:14,078
I never got yours.

265
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:15,992
Helena.

266
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:20,136
And last name?

267
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:22,442
You're doing all this work,

268
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:24,502
but how long can that last,

269
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,955
when the real police find me?

270
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:29,145
You are me, I'm you,

271
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,385
we're both the victim and the cop.

272
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:35,014
Yeah, that would be bad for both of us.

273
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:38,067
So come see me, discuss.

274
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,669
I already gave you directions.

275
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:42,784
Hey, c'mere.

276
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:46,162
The numbers, they're addresses.

277
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:52,244
Okay, 17 is the street number of the quarry

278
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,276
where we found Jane Doe.

279
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:55,347
Yeah. Rooming house,

280
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:57,881
shooting scene,

281
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,726
the kid's house,

282
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:01,397
even the precinct...

283
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:02,422
everywhere we've been.

284
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,532
Except one... 1024. GPS gives one address

285
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:06,495
with that street number,

286
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:08,622
10 minutes from the kid's
house, Lakepoint Road.

287
00:14:08,634 --> 00:14:10,405
No, I know that place.

288
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:12,281
A lot of squatters around there.

289
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:13,927
- Let's check it out.
- Hold it.

290
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:16,148
Wait for emergency tactical, huh?

291
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:17,331
This is a probable sniper,

292
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,408
so let them sweep it,
first, before you go in.

293
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:21,448
- Got it?
- Yeah.

294
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:24,995
Hey, don't worry. Let's do this.

295
00:14:33,987 --> 00:14:35,594
I'm parked over here, so.

296
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:37,796
No no no no no. After last night,

297
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,005
we stick together. Come on.

298
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:08,391
Whoa, Beth!

299
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:09,913
Rough night?

300
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:13,883
Okeydoke, then.

301
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,429
Out.

302
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:58,511
What?

303
00:15:58,631 --> 00:16:00,895
Anybody else feel like they
have a target on their back?

304
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:04,581
- All clear.
- Copy. Okay,

305
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:06,651
I'll take you guys in for a closer look.

306
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:08,347
You're going to love it.

307
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:43,640
Over here, detectives.

308
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,447
Looks like more self-surgery.

309
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:57,297
Can't be long 'til she bleeds out.

310
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:02,196
Ho-ly shit.

311
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,937
It's the same figures
as the fortune teller.

312
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:08,478
She saying she's a serial killer?

313
00:17:08,598 --> 00:17:10,436
Could be her single victim,

314
00:17:10,468 --> 00:17:13,653
our Jane Doe, over and over again.

315
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:16,030
Or she just draws like a third-grader.

316
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:18,408
This her?

317
00:17:20,148 --> 00:17:21,849
Or her next victim?

318
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,502
Next victim.

319
00:18:25,514 --> 00:18:27,058
Detective Childs.

320
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:28,617
Hey, it's me.

321
00:18:29,655 --> 00:18:31,301
- Paul?
- Oh.

322
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:33,303
Hello, Paul.

323
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:34,655
How are you doing?

324
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:38,759
- Mm, not too good. I got beat up.
- What?!

325
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:39,635
What happened?

326
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:41,744
Oh, please come get me outta here.

327
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:47,812
She led us here.

328
00:18:48,056 --> 00:18:49,732
She wanted us to see this.

329
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:51,140
May be a wild goose chase,

330
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:52,651
- wasting our time.
- No.

331
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,871
She had a reason.

332
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:56,864
Okay, let's let forensics have this.

333
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,460
I hope you don't have dinner plans.

334
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,111
Yeah, I'll be right with you.

335
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:09,434
Is it my imagination,

336
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,134
or does Cosima have
bigger breasts than you?

337
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,305
There's no way I can make
dinner with Kira tonight.

338
00:19:13,324 --> 00:19:14,506
Well, you've got to.

339
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:16,508
I can't. I'm stuck with Art

340
00:19:16,628 --> 00:19:18,435
and this bitch is right on top of me.

341
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:19,924
I could lead her straight to Kira.

342
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:22,571
I know, but Mrs S gave you an ultimatum.

343
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:23,691
She's going to cut you off.

344
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:25,299
Rock and a hard place, here, Fe.

345
00:19:25,292 --> 00:19:27,436
Yeah, your permanent address.

346
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,391
I do have one really idiotic idea.

347
00:19:30,454 --> 00:19:32,055
Oh, good.

348
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:34,258
I need to be in two places at once, yeah?

349
00:19:34,295 --> 00:19:35,244
Yeah.

350
00:19:35,364 --> 00:19:37,955
Well, if anybody can do that, we can.

351
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:40,416
Are you effing serious?!

352
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:42,952
Yeah, suddenly, I am.

353
00:20:18,155 --> 00:20:19,836
What happened? Is she okay?

354
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,500
Yeah, she's okay. She's fine.

355
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,693
That doesn't sound okay.

356
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:25,473
Sarah needs your help with her daughter.

357
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,251
I'll get the drawings out
to my criminal-psych guy.

358
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:35,102
Where's missing persons on our Jane Doe?

359
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,003
Nothing local.

360
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,236
Well, widen the net.

361
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:38,662
How wide?

362
00:20:38,725 --> 00:20:40,113
North America.

363
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:42,766
Whoa, quick change.

364
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:44,950
Huh?

365
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,189
Your whole look,

366
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:47,665
it's cleaned right up.

367
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:50,030
Looks way better.

368
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,807
Keep it in your pants, Raj.

369
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:55,110
Uh, sorry.

370
00:20:55,285 --> 00:20:56,430
Guys,

371
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:58,227
what the hell?

372
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,329
Nice to know someone's having fun.

373
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,193
Maggie Chen?

374
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,547
I'm sorry, but she wants me

375
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:58,255
to impersonate her,

376
00:21:58,249 --> 00:21:59,776
in front of her own daughter,

377
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:01,300
who she hasn't seen in almost a year?

378
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,557
10 months.

379
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,622
This is terrible parenting, Felix.

380
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:06,136
I mean, that poor child.

381
00:22:06,161 --> 00:22:08,470
I don't think you understand
the situation here.

382
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:10,510
If Sarah misses tonight,

383
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,205
then she may never get Kira back.

384
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:14,402
I'm sorry, but a request like this?

385
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:16,472
Maybe the child is better off

386
00:22:16,516 --> 00:22:17,129
with your foster mother.

387
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:18,706
Excuse me?

388
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:21,571
Sarah is out there, risking her life,

389
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:23,436
playing cat-and-mouse
with killer clone,

390
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:25,325
so that your kids don't end up orphans,

391
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:27,730
and you think that she should
lose her child for that?

392
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,596
Yeah.

393
00:22:30,665 --> 00:22:32,710
I think you need to step up, here, sister.

394
00:22:36,202 --> 00:22:37,553
Well, I did just play Annelle

395
00:22:37,584 --> 00:22:38,817
in "Steel Magnolias".

396
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:39,968
Seriously?

397
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:42,896
Mm-hmm. Glendale community theatre.

398
00:22:43,547 --> 00:22:46,237
Annelle, Annelle... oh, my God!

399
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:47,907
The Daryl Hannah part?

400
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:49,034
Yeah.

401
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,191
Terrible casting.

402
00:22:51,223 --> 00:22:54,088
It was actually very good acting, Felix.

403
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:55,646
Trust me, Sarah's no stretch.

404
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:56,872
I got great reviews.

405
00:22:56,928 --> 00:22:58,718
From the whole neighborhood, I'm sure.

406
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:00,457
Ahem.

407
00:23:01,408 --> 00:23:03,291
The rain in Spain

408
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,926
falls mainly on the plain.

409
00:23:06,046 --> 00:23:08,979
Okay, Eliza. Holy shit.

410
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:12,471
We need to pull a full
reverse "Pygmalion" here.

411
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:36,865
My crime-psych guy says

412
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:38,530
biblically messed up or not,

413
00:23:38,573 --> 00:23:40,356
woman-on-woman means
its got to be personal,

414
00:23:40,356 --> 00:23:42,227
whether it's her first or 15th kill.

415
00:23:42,902 --> 00:23:44,116
Yeah, no, that makes sense.

416
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,424
So we're back to Jane Doe

417
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,520
and who she was to Jane death.

418
00:23:47,914 --> 00:23:49,679
Something's gotta give.

419
00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:51,787
When it does, you know?

420
00:23:52,237 --> 00:23:55,015
Yeah. Right behind ya.

421
00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:56,417
Ahem.

422
00:23:58,316 --> 00:24:00,395
These are your worst clothes?

423
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:02,047
Well, I'm sorry, mate,

424
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:03,442
but I don't shop secondhand.

425
00:24:03,562 --> 00:24:06,914
No, no, my God, no. It's not "mate",

426
00:24:06,965 --> 00:24:08,679
all right? It's more like, um,

427
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,343
it's like "might".

428
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:11,463
- "Might".
- Yeah.

429
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:13,040
'Ello, "might".

430
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,100
Yeah, that's better. But,

431
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:19,465
look, you're going to
have to get past Mrs S,

432
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:22,537
so you really got to play the
dreary history there, you know?

433
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:24,045
I mean, you basically won't talk.

434
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:25,904
This shirt is all wrong.

435
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:27,824
Hey! Hey hey!

436
00:24:28,037 --> 00:24:30,634
Not "hey"! You're a punk.

437
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,842
Be one.

438
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:33,916
Oi!

439
00:24:45,707 --> 00:24:46,958
Detective Childs.

440
00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:49,360
There's a visitor for you.

441
00:24:55,178 --> 00:24:56,636
Hey hey hey. What are you doing here?

442
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,376
You said come get you.

443
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,134
What happened? Are you okay?

444
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:04,170
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm fine. Really.

445
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:06,290
You didn't sound fine and you don't

446
00:25:06,353 --> 00:25:07,373
look fine.

447
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,632
Come on, I took the rest of the day off.

448
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,184
Whatever you need, okay?

449
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,843
- No no no. No. Paul, I can't!
- Paul!

450
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:16,063
Everything all right here?

451
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:18,234
Does she seem all right to you?!

452
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:20,824
Okay. Take it easy.

453
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,852
First day back, she gets beat up?

454
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:24,541
No wonder she wants to leave.

455
00:25:24,604 --> 00:25:25,755
Boy, what the hell are you talking about?

456
00:25:25,755 --> 00:25:29,171
No no no no. Paul, please. Art? I got this.

457
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:32,174
Do you?

458
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:35,885
What am I doing here?

459
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,131
Sorry, I overreacted.

460
00:25:38,343 --> 00:25:40,896
I didn't mean literally
"come get me this second".

461
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,329
Then what did you mean?

462
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:43,730
Because, seriously, you're like

463
00:25:43,724 --> 00:25:46,332
a completely different person, these days.

464
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:50,449
Sorry, it's this case. It's a bitch.

465
00:25:50,487 --> 00:25:53,196
I got upset, so I asked you to come get me.

466
00:25:56,342 --> 00:25:57,725
I didn't say I minded.

467
00:25:58,895 --> 00:26:02,680
Look, we need to spend some time together,

468
00:26:03,331 --> 00:26:05,781
figure out what's suddenly going on with us

469
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:09,416
because most of it, I like,

470
00:26:10,123 --> 00:26:11,612
a lot.

471
00:26:20,223 --> 00:26:21,460
Paul.

472
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:28,931
Think about it.

473
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:43,533
So,

474
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:46,311
the woman Beth shot and
Helena are connected.

475
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,775
Holy watershed.

476
00:26:47,844 --> 00:26:49,995
Okay, Beth probably shot
Maggie Chen on purpose.

477
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:52,085
She never told us anything about this.

478
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:54,056
Yeah, she never told her partner, either.

479
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,696
I can't keep doing this, Cosima.

480
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,036
Helena was here. She was Beth.

481
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:00,612
She's going to get us both busted,

482
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,889
unless I meet her, alone.

483
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:04,560
Oh, my God. Bad idea.

484
00:27:04,585 --> 00:27:06,769
Yeah, she thinks we have a connection.

485
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:07,670
Do you?

486
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,096
Yeah, we're clones.

487
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:11,944
Right. So what do the cops know?

488
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:14,603
She's a churchy psychopath. Duh.

489
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:16,298
It's personal.

490
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:18,796
She's a loner, probably abused as a child.

491
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:20,252
Okay, so,

492
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,704
the fish

493
00:27:21,735 --> 00:27:23,043
reads Christian

494
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:25,696
and, crafted onto a weapon?

495
00:27:25,752 --> 00:27:27,422
A personal crusade.

496
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:29,043
Great. Is that it?

497
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:30,741
You know, when I'm seeing this

498
00:27:30,757 --> 00:27:33,059
branded onto Maggie Chen, I'm thinking that

499
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:34,242
she's not a lone warrior.

500
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:36,331
To extreme creationist types,

501
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:38,121
we would be abominations.

502
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:40,723
Like, not God's children,
but, but, Satan's.

503
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:44,390
So they hate us and she's killing us,

504
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:46,980
even though she's identical to us?

505
00:27:47,005 --> 00:27:49,463
Well, but if you were a
messed-up, abused loner

506
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:51,359
whose faith compelled you

507
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,125
to belong and somebody that you trusted

508
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:57,334
told you that this was
the way to redeem yourself

509
00:27:57,388 --> 00:27:59,530
in the eyes of God, I mean...

510
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,270
Yeah, I might become an angry angel, too.

511
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,329
Okay, got it. Thanks.

512
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:11,643
Something you want to tell me?

513
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:13,145
About Paul?

514
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:16,054
No. I've got him wrapped
around my little finger.

515
00:28:16,098 --> 00:28:18,557
What's he talking about, leaving?

516
00:28:18,677 --> 00:28:20,102
We just got you back, Beth.

517
00:28:20,644 --> 00:28:22,498
No, he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

518
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:24,312
Things are just messy right now.

519
00:28:24,315 --> 00:28:25,457
Yeah, I heard that.

520
00:28:25,514 --> 00:28:28,079
But we don't bring that
shit in here, right?

521
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:28,967
I know.

522
00:28:29,219 --> 00:28:30,431
It's so frickin' embarrassing.

523
00:28:30,437 --> 00:28:32,483
Don't worry. It won't happen again.

524
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,643
I thought you two were calling it quits.

525
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:38,077
Yeah, we were, but, now,

526
00:28:38,102 --> 00:28:39,394
we're trying to work it out.

527
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:42,620
You know how things go.

528
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:44,684
Right.

529
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:46,912
Let's get back on track.

530
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,745
This killer.

531
00:28:48,865 --> 00:28:50,403
You had a close-quarters
run-in with her.

532
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:51,811
Did you get anything else?

533
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:53,394
Something she said?

534
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:54,777
If she'd said anything,

535
00:28:54,777 --> 00:28:56,560
I would've known she was a woman.

536
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:00,989
Yeah. I'm going to check with Beckwith.

537
00:29:01,585 --> 00:29:03,719
She's making progress on Jane Doe.

538
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:04,399
Mm.

539
00:29:04,424 --> 00:29:06,207
She'll have facial reconstruction soon.

540
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:08,857
Great.

541
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:16,048
Detective Childs.

542
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:20,090
Things must be getting
uncomfortable there for you now.

543
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:21,691
Helena,

544
00:29:21,735 --> 00:29:24,462
you forgot something. Your friend Maggie.

545
00:29:24,582 --> 00:29:27,891
Oh, you're a terrible detective.

546
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:29,692
Beth figured that out.

547
00:29:29,812 --> 00:29:31,946
Well, Beth shot her, not me,

548
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:33,385
if it's revenge you're after.

549
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,406
It's not about revenge.

550
00:29:35,863 --> 00:29:37,195
It's about you.

551
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:39,729
Right, we have a connection.

552
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:42,789
You want to tell me about that?

553
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:44,384
In person.

554
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:47,249
You have my invitation.

555
00:29:57,022 --> 00:30:00,859
My name is Detective Beth Childs.

556
00:30:01,141 --> 00:30:04,544
I murdered Margaret Chen.

557
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:07,303
It wasn't an accident.

558
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:10,044
I shot her on purpose.

559
00:30:29,188 --> 00:30:30,928
I'm gasping for a fag.

560
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:33,361
No, you're not. Sarah never smoked.

561
00:30:33,818 --> 00:30:35,345
Okay, it's curtain time.

562
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:37,047
So just remember that

563
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:38,917
an insult is a greeting,

564
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:40,713
but you're trying not to
lose your temper, yeah?

565
00:30:40,725 --> 00:30:42,445
Mm-hmm.

566
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:47,663
Wait. Um, thanks.

567
00:30:49,453 --> 00:30:50,873
Okay.

568
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,738
Over-slouching.
You're over-slouching.

569
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:54,937
Shut up.

570
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,923
Now you got it.

571
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:01,096
Oi-oi, Mrs S!

572
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:05,657
Not driving the nice new Jag today, then?

573
00:31:05,777 --> 00:31:07,903
- It's in the shop.
- Mm-hmm.

574
00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:10,784
Are you going to let me
see my daughter, or what?

575
00:31:19,323 --> 00:31:20,975
What are you gaping at?

576
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:41,884
Something I can do?

577
00:31:43,617 --> 00:31:44,868
You ever fight a woman?

578
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:47,308
Depends. Business or pleasure?

579
00:31:47,696 --> 00:31:49,692
Look, they do say crazy makes you strong.

580
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:52,895
But women, they look different,

581
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:56,317
fight different, smell different.

582
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:58,275
This woman is a trained sniper.

583
00:31:58,313 --> 00:32:00,385
But Beth taking her for a man,

584
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:03,230
- that flies with you?
- Mm.

585
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:06,321
This whole time, it feels like she's got

586
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,059
something else chewing on her mind.

587
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:10,212
You know, a civilian
shooting's hard to shake.

588
00:32:10,214 --> 00:32:11,965
Maybe she's back too soon.

589
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:13,691
I don't know if that's even it.

590
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,512
Where is she, anyway?

591
00:32:26,014 --> 00:32:28,579
Could be she's just working it
out with her boyfriend, right?

592
00:32:28,617 --> 00:32:30,988
Yeah, could be.

593
00:32:37,536 --> 00:32:39,544
- What?
- Nothing.

594
00:32:50,611 --> 00:32:52,576
So what, now, invisible ink?

595
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,122
Mind the store, Angie.

596
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,787
Maybe I should come with.

597
00:33:09,006 --> 00:33:10,801
Come on, Art. What's up?

598
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:12,684
You'll know when I do.

599
00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:33,077
Kira, your mum's waiting.

600
00:33:33,197 --> 00:33:35,252
Hurry up, love. Come on.

601
00:33:41,805 --> 00:33:44,475
Here she is. Look, she's here.

602
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:48,210
She won't bite, love.

603
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:54,360
Oi, are you shy now, or something?

604
00:33:56,756 --> 00:33:57,782
Is that for me?

605
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:01,643
Can I see it?

606
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:08,731
How about a cuppa in the kitchen, yeah?

607
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:10,099
Wow!

608
00:34:14,193 --> 00:34:15,371
Give us a hug?

609
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:21,407
I'm sorry we haven't

610
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,309
seen each other in a long time,

611
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:24,992
but we can change all that,

612
00:34:25,055 --> 00:34:27,107
see each other all the time?

613
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:30,586
You're not my mother.

614
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:40,671
Silly.

615
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,435
Of course I'm your mum.

616
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,362
Who else would I be?

617
00:34:49,392 --> 00:34:51,075
You just look like her.

618
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,880
It's still me, Kira.

619
00:34:57,882 --> 00:34:59,796
What do you call me?

620
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:01,323
Monkey.

621
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:02,430
What else?

622
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:06,196
Monkey... bum?

623
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:08,010
Face?

624
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,399
Where's my mum?

625
00:35:13,228 --> 00:35:15,998
Art, if you're hearing this,

626
00:35:16,588 --> 00:35:18,108
you found the body.

627
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:21,856
It's not Beth. It's me.

628
00:35:23,126 --> 00:35:25,590
My name is Sarah Manning and...

629
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:28,519
you're about the only person I trust

630
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:30,584
to figure the whole thing out.

631
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:36,252
Kira, your mother
couldn't be here right now.

632
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:37,767
Why?

633
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,669
Police! Stay inside!

634
00:35:56,841 --> 00:35:58,993
Because she is out there, right now,

635
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:01,132
doing something very brave.

636
00:36:01,178 --> 00:36:04,681
She's making sure everything is safe

637
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,589
so you two can be together.

638
00:36:25,035 --> 00:36:26,571
I'm unarmed.

639
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:34,541
Turn around.

640
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:37,964
Turn around! All the way.

641
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:41,029
Kneel.

642
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:43,500
I'm guessing you know how.

643
00:36:44,907 --> 00:36:48,010
This isn't necessary. Kneel down.

644
00:36:50,024 --> 00:36:52,220
You're different than the others.

645
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:54,096
Yeah, I am.

646
00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:56,700
Uh!

647
00:36:57,269 --> 00:36:59,478
You wanted to talk? Let's talk.

648
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:02,031
I think I'm dying.

649
00:37:04,284 --> 00:37:05,779
Yeah, I think I'll watch.

650
00:37:13,669 --> 00:37:15,084
Where did you come from?

651
00:37:16,097 --> 00:37:17,629
I came out of the woodwork.

652
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:19,019
Where did you come from?

653
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:20,389
God sent me.

654
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,658
Right, so you don't know, either.

655
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,206
You don't know God.

656
00:37:24,237 --> 00:37:25,794
This God?

657
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:28,598
The one branded on your friend Maggie Chen?

658
00:37:28,718 --> 00:37:31,895
Maggie helped make you.

659
00:37:34,811 --> 00:37:36,525
Then she saw the light

660
00:37:36,894 --> 00:37:38,540
and came to our side.

661
00:37:39,497 --> 00:37:41,594
Beth killed her to protect us.

662
00:37:41,938 --> 00:37:43,533
I can save you.

663
00:37:44,572 --> 00:37:46,215
Right, because we have a connection.

664
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:48,251
I can see a light in you.

665
00:37:48,294 --> 00:37:49,884
There's a light in all of us.

666
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:51,153
No!

667
00:37:51,273 --> 00:37:52,824
N... no!

668
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,070
The others,

669
00:37:55,095 --> 00:37:57,759
poor copies of God's image of human beings.

670
00:37:58,062 --> 00:37:59,543
But not you?

671
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:01,397
You're special?

672
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,034
They told you you were
the original, didn't they?

673
00:38:20,985 --> 00:38:21,998
You people!

674
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:24,476
It's not true, what they said!

675
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,291
We're genetic identicals.

676
00:38:26,334 --> 00:38:27,742
Let me save you.

677
00:38:27,748 --> 00:38:31,036
You, me, Beth, the German you killed!

678
00:38:31,011 --> 00:38:32,362
We're all made the same.

679
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:34,645
Whoever told you different

680
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:36,710
hates you as much as they hate us.

681
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:37,817
You're wrong.

682
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:43,505
What happened to you, Helena?

683
00:38:47,777 --> 00:38:49,344
Stay back!

684
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:57,869
Can you feel it?

685
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:03,857
Beth!

686
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:11,045
Beth!

687
00:39:13,078 --> 00:39:14,048
Beth!

688
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,303
Beth, are you in there?

689
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:24,443
Run!

690
00:39:28,815 --> 00:39:30,953
You don't feel it?

691
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,680
- There's no one here!
- You're here.

692
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,893
Why?

693
00:39:48,301 --> 00:39:49,621
Beth!

694
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,404
The apartment of the woman you killed?

695
00:39:52,749 --> 00:39:54,783
What the hell are you thinking?

696
00:39:59,513 --> 00:40:01,314
How can you be my auntie Alison?

697
00:40:01,434 --> 00:40:03,473
My mum doesn't have any sisters.

698
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:05,466
My mum doesn't even have a mum.

699
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:08,436
Well, it's very complicated.

700
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,883
But, Kira, I'm sorry about this,

701
00:40:11,883 --> 00:40:13,228
but it's very important

702
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:16,275
that you keep this a secret, right?

703
00:40:17,226 --> 00:40:18,471
Promise?

704
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:21,794
Getting on for bedtime, Kira, love.

705
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,489
Up you go. Get your PJs.

706
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:27,807
Pinkies.

707
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,140
Bye, mummy.

708
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:39,118
Scoot.

709
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:43,299
Thanks for everything.

710
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:44,838
Well, you kept your word. You showed up.

711
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,452
I mean Kira.

712
00:40:47,115 --> 00:40:50,619
She's well and that's, uh, down to you.

713
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:52,677
Sarah.

714
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:55,656
I'm just, uh,

715
00:40:55,776 --> 00:40:58,559
I'm not used to an honest
word on the subject.

716
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:04,777
Um, I'd like to do this again,

717
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:06,417
sooner, rather than later.

718
00:41:06,537 --> 00:41:09,048
I'm not opposed, long as we take it slowly.

719
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:11,822
So, I'll be by tomorrow

720
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,236
to walk her home from school.

721
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,733
Straight home.

722
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:18,023
Well, all right, then.

723
00:41:19,006 --> 00:41:20,477
Well, unleash the doves.

724
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,474
World peace must be
right around the corner.

725
00:41:23,737 --> 00:41:25,695
Piss off, you.

726
00:41:33,272 --> 00:41:36,213
Well, aren't you full of surprises.

727
00:41:36,188 --> 00:41:37,063
You passed!

728
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:39,347
You turned S's head for your Uncle. Mwah!

729
00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:41,123
Well, that's something.

730
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:42,907
Uh-oh.

731
00:41:43,107 --> 00:41:44,699
Kira knew right away.

732
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:46,373
No.

733
00:41:47,223 --> 00:41:48,721
Oh, shite!

734
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:56,795
I just don't get it.

735
00:41:56,797 --> 00:41:58,509
It doesn't make any sense to me.

736
00:41:58,899 --> 00:42:00,874
Just explain to us why you were

737
00:42:00,874 --> 00:42:02,414
at the home of Maggie Chen.

738
00:42:02,595 --> 00:42:05,467
Like I said, I was taking a walk

739
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,894
to clear my head. I found myself there.

740
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:09,918
You just found yourself there? Yeah.

741
00:42:10,038 --> 00:42:12,352
"Yes" or "no"... is
there a connection between

742
00:42:12,352 --> 00:42:15,247
the Maggie Chen shooting death
and this Jane Doe homicide?

743
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:16,582
None.

744
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:18,684
Well, you called this meeting, Beth.

745
00:42:18,804 --> 00:42:20,319
What the hell are we doing here?

746
00:42:21,448 --> 00:42:24,702
After the Chen thing, I came
back to prove that I could,

747
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:27,893
but I'm not doing anybody any good, so,

748
00:42:29,207 --> 00:42:30,829
I quit.

749
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,118
After all we've done for you?

750
00:42:34,168 --> 00:42:35,549
Yeah. I appreciate it, but...

751
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:38,003
But you bail. Why?

752
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,368
What is it with you?!

753
00:42:40,737 --> 00:42:43,175
Walking out's not the answer, Childs.

754
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:45,043
So how does this go?

755
00:42:48,188 --> 00:42:50,021
Something like this?

756
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:36,459
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

757
00:43:38,014 --> 00:43:39,398
What'll they do to me?

758
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,666
This is about Paul, right?

759
00:43:40,668 --> 00:43:42,935
We think Beth was spying on him.

760
00:43:42,937 --> 00:43:44,477
She wasn't messing around, was she?

761
00:43:44,505 --> 00:43:46,672
Maybe it's time to find
out where Paul works.

762
00:43:46,674 --> 00:43:48,382
What happened to your scar?

763
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:50,352
Why were you in my vanity?

764
00:43:50,472 --> 00:43:52,960
- Donnie, what's in the box?!
- I don't know who you are.

765
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:55,014
Sarah, I thought you were dead!

766
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:56,628
Is someone trying to hurt us?

767
00:43:56,748 --> 00:43:58,029
Why do you ask that?

768
00:44:00,073 --> 00:44:01,520
How could you do that to her?
