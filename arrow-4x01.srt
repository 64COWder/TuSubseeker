1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:02,951
Last season on Arrow...

2
00:00:02,953 --> 00:00:05,243
Was it worth it, all the pain and misery

3
00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:06,777
you brought back from that island?

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,145
The reason I came back

5
00:00:08,147 --> 00:00:10,681
was to try and save
the people of this city.

6
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:11,782
You've got the wrong guy.

7
00:00:11,784 --> 00:00:12,949
Oliver Queen isn't the Arrow.

8
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:14,050
I am.

9
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:17,254
Everyone thinks
the Arrow is dead,

10
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:19,423
which means Oliver Queen is innocent.

11
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:21,392
When I joined the League I
was conscripted with another man,

12
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:23,827
Damian Darhk. Damian continues
the League's ways,

13
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:27,498
but through his own organization
filled with a hive of agents.

14
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,465
John?

15
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:30,000
Something's wrong.

16
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:31,968
First let me assure you that
no harm will come to Lyla.

17
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,305
You didn't just lose
my friendship,

18
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:36,507
you lost my trust.
You lost my respect.

19
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:39,209
It was about making sure
that you and you were safe.

20
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:42,012
I had to keep the circle
as small as possible.

21
00:00:42,014 --> 00:00:45,316
You opened up my heart in a way

22
00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:48,652
I didn't even know was possible.

23
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:50,521
And I love you.

24
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:52,656
Can I say something strange?

25
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:54,057
I'm happy.

26
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:14,244
How you doin'?

27
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:24,688
Hey.

28
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,425
Oh. Ok.

29
00:01:29,528 --> 00:01:30,705
Hot.

30
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,066
Felicity Smoak...

31
00:01:37,803 --> 00:01:40,303
You have failed this omelet.

32
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:42,439
Really?

33
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:43,841
Yeah.

34
00:01:45,644 --> 00:01:49,279
You know, it's criminal how
easily cooking's come to you.

35
00:01:49,281 --> 00:01:51,515
Well, I always wanted
to expand my horizons

36
00:01:51,517 --> 00:01:53,517
beyond what I could do
on the island,

37
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,287
which was basically...
Was cooked and uncooked.

38
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,389
How was your jog?

39
00:01:58,391 --> 00:01:59,890
It was good.

40
00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:01,558
I'm getting used to running

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,659
without chasing after someone.

42
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:05,095
Kind of sweaty.

43
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:07,798
I know. It's amazing.

44
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,836
Why'd you get this one removed?

45
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:14,971
I don't need it anymore.

46
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:19,276
So what do you have planned
for the rest of the day?

47
00:02:19,278 --> 00:02:21,779
A video conference
with the Palmer Tech board,

48
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:26,417
who still question whether I'm fit
enough to inherit Ray's legacy.

49
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:27,918
Hey, how'd you like
the company back

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,720
as an early Christmas gift?

51
00:02:29,722 --> 00:02:31,822
You're doing a better job
of running it than I would.

52
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:33,256
It's flirting with bankruptcy.

53
00:02:33,258 --> 00:02:35,292
Exactly. This is flirting.

54
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:37,594
I gotta go.

55
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:38,929
Where are you going now?

56
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:40,597
I have to get stuff
at the Farmers Market

57
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,965
for brunch tomorrow.

58
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:44,768
Right. The Hoffmans
are coming over. I forgot.

59
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,804
I'm never gonna get tired
of making plans

60
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:48,739
that don't involve
people shooting at me.

61
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:58,549
This is so cool!

62
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:01,752
We're really gonna have to
work on your definition of cool.

63
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:06,490
Get me up there.

64
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:08,191
This is so awesome!

65
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:18,201
Speedy, behind you!

66
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:22,673
I thought I told you guys
to call me Red Arrow.

67
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:26,343
A Red Arrow just means
you can't make a left turn.

68
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:28,545
Whatever. I'm inside
the hijacked truck.

69
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:43,961
Canary, you're up.

70
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:04,848
They've got backup.

71
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:36,807
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

72
00:04:38,784 --> 00:04:42,019
Anyone manage to get eyes
on that stolen cargo?

73
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:45,889
They look like
equipment containers.

74
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:47,858
Not equipment. Weapons.

75
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,426
Among other things,
Kord Industries

76
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:51,361
is one of the largest arms
manufacturers in the world.

77
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:53,697
They also make a really
awesome cell phone.

78
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,666
Yeah, but weapons
are more likely.

79
00:04:55,668 --> 00:05:00,003
Much. These Ghosts, if that's
seriously what we're calling them,

80
00:05:00,005 --> 00:05:01,438
are stepping up their attacks.

81
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Escalating. People are so scared,

82
00:05:03,442 --> 00:05:05,075
they don't even want
to leave their homes.

83
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:06,543
Unless it's to pack up
in the middle of the night,

84
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:07,911
get the hell out of town.

85
00:05:07,913 --> 00:05:09,613
What do you want us to do,

86
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:11,147
take our football and go home?

87
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:13,850
No. We ask for help.

88
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:16,820
Oliver walked away.

89
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:20,123
That was before these guys
started taking over our city

90
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,325
and turning it into a war zone.
We're dealing with a crisis.

91
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:25,963
Which Oliver believed
we could handle, Laurel.

92
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:27,530
And he was right.

93
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:34,170
I spoke to Walter Steele
last night. He passed.

94
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:36,272
Well, does that surprise you?

95
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,675
In 3 years we've had 3 mayors
and one candidate for mayor

96
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:40,944
who've all ended up dead.
Anyone with any common sense

97
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:42,479
is not gonna throw
their hat in the ring.

98
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:44,314
So we just go on as we have,

99
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:46,249
running City Hall by committee
instead of electing a mayor?

100
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:49,486
Maybe we should have you focused
on catching these Ghosts.

101
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:51,154
That's just what
the media calls them,

102
00:05:51,156 --> 00:05:52,522
because they disappear
like ghosts.

103
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:54,491
Yeah, I didn't say
it wasn't cute.

104
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:57,861
The truth is, these guys
are hard to catch.

105
00:05:57,863 --> 00:05:59,796
They're not your average
everyday criminals.

106
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:02,099
Average everyday criminals
don't have cyanide capsules

107
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:05,836
in their teeth so they can off themselves
rather than be interrogated.

108
00:06:05,838 --> 00:06:07,070
I'm doin' the best I can here.

109
00:06:07,072 --> 00:06:08,939
We need you to do better.

110
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:12,042
This city was dying before more masks
showed up to wreak havoc.

111
00:06:12,044 --> 00:06:15,178
Look, we'll get these guys eventually
and things will turn around.

112
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,913
I mean, look,
we rebranded the city,

113
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:18,982
we got the new tourism program,

114
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:20,717
we got the new high-speed
rail line to Central City.

115
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,686
Hopefully from Central City.

116
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:25,922
Well, maybe we can have
a Flash Day, just like them.

117
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:28,625
Bottom line, we need
an influx of people,

118
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:31,261
which means an influx of cash.

119
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:37,333
Oh, no. Keep your seats.

120
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:39,903
Excuse me, this is
a private meeting.

121
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:41,004
Oh, excellent.

122
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:44,074
I despise interruptions.

123
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:45,475
Who the hell are you?

124
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:48,311
Me? I'm the man
you're looking for.

125
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:52,049
I'm the one who controls...
what do you people call them?

126
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:54,818
The Ghosts?

127
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,520
So you're all fretting
about the city dying.

128
00:06:57,522 --> 00:06:59,422
I'm here on behalf
of an organization

129
00:06:59,424 --> 00:07:02,092
that wants you to let it die.

130
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:03,326
See, death is a beautiful thing.

131
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:04,995
We die, we go into the ground,

132
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:07,164
our remains grow into flowers.

133
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:11,367
It's only in the interval after
dying that new things can sprout.

134
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:12,969
That's enough...
get the hell out of...

135
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:15,605
Cities are like puppies.

136
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:18,608
You see them writhing
in agony on the streets,

137
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,943
you put them down.
You don't let them suffer.

138
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:21,178
I'm getting security.

139
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,047
Susanna, calm down. Get down.

140
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:27,184
That's very rude behavior.

141
00:07:28,854 --> 00:07:32,422
None of you seem
particularly likeable,

142
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:34,758
but if you do have any friends

143
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,792
or anyone who does love you,

144
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:38,628
I suggest you say goodbye.

145
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,363
My people will be in touch.

146
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,571
Oh, Oliver,

147
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:49,906
these eggs are heaven.

148
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:51,842
Don't tell me you made them...

149
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:54,310
In the slow cooker. The slow
cooker you got us, yeah.

150
00:07:54,312 --> 00:07:55,779
I knew it. I knew it.

151
00:07:55,781 --> 00:07:57,881
People are always
so hesitant to try them,

152
00:07:57,883 --> 00:07:59,816
but slow cookers
are absolute life-changers.

153
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:01,818
I don't know how that
is not a bumper sticker yet.

154
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,720
I know.

155
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:05,355
On the topic of life-changers,

156
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:08,524
you guys really need to get
on the school situation here.

157
00:08:08,526 --> 00:08:11,561
We could write you a recommendation
letter for our school's waiting list.

158
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:15,999
But... but wouldn't it help to have
kids first, or, I don't know, a kid?

159
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:18,235
Oh, it takes years
to get on that list.

160
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:21,071
And I'm sure kids aren't too far
down the line for you two.

161
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:23,039
Yeah, we haven't
talked about it.

162
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,142
Who wants more Mimosas?

163
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:26,828
I need to see it.
Do you have it on you?

164
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:27,361
Honey...

165
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:30,446
You have it on you, right?
Do you have it?

166
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:32,015
Yeah.

167
00:08:34,153 --> 00:08:35,652
Oh, it's stunning.

168
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:36,853
It's my mother's.

169
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:38,155
So, when are you gonna

170
00:08:38,157 --> 00:08:39,389
pop the question?

171
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:40,657
Tonight.

172
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,391
What are you guys talking...

173
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:44,627
Dude!

174
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,763
Nice reflexes!

175
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:51,050
FIVE YEARS AGO

176
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:58,041
Back off, psycho.

177
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:59,609
6 people have died

178
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:01,344
from the crank
you've been pushing.

179
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:02,879
4 of them were kids!

180
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:30,006
You've certainly chosen
an unusual hobby, Mr. Queen.

181
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:31,975
He said he'd kill us all.

182
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:34,010
That was a hell
of a press conference.

183
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:36,012
These people needed
a strong reminder

184
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:38,381
that the city doesn't
bow to terrorists.

185
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:39,950
Susanna?

186
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:44,187
I thought that tasted funny.

187
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,123
Call 911!

188
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,227
John, we have a new problem.

189
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,229
The city's leadership
is being targeted.

190
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:53,363
They just poisoned
the district attorney.

191
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:54,998
I'm headed to my father.

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,875
I need you and Thea
and all the other two members.

193
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:58,511
STAR CITY HALL
EMPLOYEE PARKING ONLY

194
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:02,505
Great.

195
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:06,910
I'm closest to the Head
of Emergency Services.

196
00:10:06,912 --> 00:10:09,045
Thea, I need you at City Hall.

197
00:10:13,118 --> 00:10:14,150
Are you ok?

198
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:18,755
Can we get a nurse over here?

199
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:21,391
Hey, listen, the district
attorney just collapsed.

200
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:23,260
Staffers think
it might be poison.

201
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:24,627
But I need toxicology...

202
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:41,144
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

203
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:42,612
It's all right.

204
00:10:42,614 --> 00:10:45,215
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

205
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:55,325
Just hold on.
I'll get you some help.

206
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:01,898
You ok?

207
00:11:05,503 --> 00:11:08,338
Captain Lance, you were warned.

208
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:33,529
Are you ok?

209
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:35,332
Oh, yeah,
it's just a flesh wound.

210
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:38,668
Captain Lance, the district attorney
was pronounced dead,

211
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,770
and reports are coming in
that the city comptroller

212
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:43,106
and the Head of Emergency
Services have also been killed.

213
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:45,475
That's pretty much
the city's leadership.

214
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:48,711
Carries on like this,
there won't be a city left to lead.

215
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,276
So what's the occasion?

216
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:54,811
We need an occasion for dinner?

217
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:56,780
No. Ever since
you discovered cooking,

218
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,415
life's been a never-ending
episode of "Master Chef."

219
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,751
But this isn't dinner.
This is a production.

220
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:04,020
Are we... celebrating something?

221
00:12:04,022 --> 00:12:06,890
It sort of depends
on how dessert goes.

222
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,259
Oh, no, no, no. I'm
almost disgustingly full.

223
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:13,774
You are going to have to try a
bite or two of this souffle.

224
00:12:14,877 --> 00:12:17,444
Oh, diet saved by the bell.

225
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:24,607
What's going on?

226
00:12:25,221 --> 00:12:27,454
You have visitors.

227
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:32,793
We probably should have
called first, but...

228
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,930
We really need your help.

229
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:37,564
The media has been calling
them The Ghosts.

230
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:38,999
They're like nothing
we'd ever seen before.

231
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:40,101
Well-trained, well-armed.

232
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:41,602
And committed.

233
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:42,970
Anytime we get too close
to one of them,

234
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,238
they off themselves
with cyanide.

235
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,572
What's their agenda?

236
00:12:45,574 --> 00:12:47,208
At first we thought
they were thieves

237
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,744
because they were hitting
banks and jewelry stores.

238
00:12:49,746 --> 00:12:52,412
But, then we found out that they'd
just been building their war chest.

239
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:54,548
They've now been stealing
munitions and heavy arms.

240
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,250
And assassinating people.

241
00:12:56,252 --> 00:12:58,819
Hon...

242
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,287
Where are the police?

243
00:13:00,289 --> 00:13:01,288
Overwhelmed.

244
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,623
Well, a group of this size

245
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,558
has to work out of
a central location,

246
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,160
a base of operations.

247
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:08,262
Which we haven't
been able to find.

248
00:13:08,264 --> 00:13:11,331
Dig seems to think
we can handle it.

249
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,733
You disagree?

250
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:15,770
I think we're in over our heads.

251
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:18,272
We need the Arrow.

252
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:26,446
The Arrow's dead.

253
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:28,448
We're hoping
that's not the case.

254
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,518
We're hoping that you can't change
who you are in your bones.

255
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,020
Come help us stop these guys,

256
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,955
and then you can
come back to your...

257
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:38,793
your domestic life of
tranquility and souffles.

258
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:45,399
You're uncharacteristically quiet.

259
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:47,434
What should I say?

260
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:50,271
Our friends need our help.
We should already be in the car.

261
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:54,541
How did you find me?

262
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,043
The world's too small

263
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,946
for someone like Oliver Queen
to disappear.

264
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:02,216
Truth be told, I expected
to find you in Starling City.

265
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:04,518
I don't want to be
near my family.

266
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,420
Because of what
you did to Shrieve?

267
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:08,289
I read his autopsy report.

268
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,391
I knew you had a capacity
for the unfathomable,

269
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,994
but I actually
underestimated you.

270
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:15,696
What do you want, Amanda?

271
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:17,198
To help you.

272
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:20,301
You haven't returned home

273
00:14:20,303 --> 00:14:22,203
because you feel
you're a monster.

274
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:24,905
You're trying to deny it, channeling
your killer instinct

275
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,074
into something productive.

276
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:30,410
But you can't change
who you are in your bones.

277
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,912
I don't need a therapist.

278
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:35,816
The hood and eye makeup
may suggest otherwise.

279
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:40,754
Stop trying to run
from your inner darkness.

280
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,957
Embrace it.

281
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,492
Let it run its course.

282
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:50,030
Oftentimes, the only way out
is through.

283
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:56,103
Through what?

284
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:08,615
Argus agents.

285
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,354
When you wake up,

286
00:15:13,356 --> 00:15:16,456
just remember
that I'm trying to help you.

287
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:20,029
STAR CITY: RENAMED IN MEMORY
OF DR. RAYMOND PALMER

288
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,684
Here I thought that my days

289
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:23,830
of riding in the back
of limos was long gone.

290
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:28,735
Ah... one of the perks of being
Palmer technology's CEO in Absentia.

291
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:31,471
Now that I'm back, they might
actually expect me to do stuff.

292
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:35,742
I wouldn't worry.
We're not going to stay long.

293
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:39,046
Jeez.

294
00:15:40,783 --> 00:15:43,583
It's tough not to look
out this window with wonder.

295
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:46,153
Wonder what?

296
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:48,822
What did we really accomplish?

297
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,026
Felicity and I have a lot
to catch up on,

298
00:15:52,028 --> 00:15:54,528
so maybe take us through all the
evidence the team has gathered.

299
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,563
That's easy. Nothing.

300
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:58,565
Ok, so maybe we'll go
through all the encounters

301
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:00,401
that you've had with The Ghosts,

302
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:03,237
everywhere they've hidden,
and places you can cross...

303
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:06,307
John...

304
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:08,008
We should have discussed this.

305
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,209
Thea and I did.

306
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:11,946
We need him.

307
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:15,649
I'm not expecting you to welcome
me back with open arms.

308
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:18,618
What I did to you
is not easily forgiven.

309
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,487
I'm here to help you
with your problem,

310
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:21,922
and then I'm gone.

311
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:23,457
Oliver, we don't need your help.

312
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:24,992
And if we did,
we'd probably choose someone

313
00:16:24,994 --> 00:16:27,094
who didn't kidnap my wife
and endanger my child.

314
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:30,197
And no one is asking you to
pretend like that didn't happen.

315
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:32,132
But we're in trouble.
The city is in trouble.

316
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:35,102
Laurel, I don't need you
to remind me of that.

317
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:37,737
I just can't go into battle
with a man I don't trust.

318
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:41,275
Understood. But things are a little
worse than you guys thought.

319
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:44,611
I hacked into Kord Industries computers
just to see what The Ghosts stole.

320
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:47,348
Cluster bombs.
Sensor fused and high yield.

321
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,882
Any more powerful and they'd
have to be nuclear.

322
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:52,186
What do you want to do, John?

323
00:16:52,188 --> 00:16:53,587
I'm gonna do whatever it takes

324
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:55,022
to save my city.

325
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:00,910
Weapons need targets.

326
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:03,045
These had to be stolen
for a reason.

327
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:05,014
Felicity, hack into Kord
Industry databases.

328
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:07,717
I want to know everything there is
to know about these explosives.

329
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,452
Laurel, we want to start
a dialogue with your father

330
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,053
and make a list
of potential targets.

331
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:14,557
Dig, Thea, hit the streets,
see what we can find.

332
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:18,761
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

333
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:20,563
Old habits.

334
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:22,465
It's probably not a bad idea

335
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:23,933
to give your father a heads-up.

336
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:26,102
Copy.

337
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:27,670
John, look...

338
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,140
I have a wife and a toddler
to get back home to.

339
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:32,074
Felicity, will you let me
know if you find anything?

340
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:35,178
Will do. Say hi to Lyla for me.

341
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,847
He'll come around.

342
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,282
I'll go hit the streets.

343
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:43,286
Well, I have to say it feels
good to be at a keyboard

344
00:17:43,288 --> 00:17:44,920
for something other
than a teleconference.

345
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:46,789
I need a map with a list
of all the spots

346
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,959
The Ghosts have hit, including
where they encountered the team.

347
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:51,994
And if we get lucky,
maybe we can...

348
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:54,297
Triangulate and determine
the point of origin

349
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,731
of where The Ghosts
are operating out of, yes?

350
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,500
Yeah.

351
00:17:57,502 --> 00:18:00,637
All right, here's the rest of
all their heists and attacks.

352
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:01,704
That was fast.

353
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,874
Yeah? Yeah, like riding a bike?

354
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,776
First spot they hit
the Larson Credit Union?

355
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:08,110
No, no, no.
It was Starling National.

356
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:09,345
Yeah?

357
00:18:09,347 --> 00:18:11,047
How'd you know that?

358
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,316
Sam way you knew about Larson.

359
00:18:13,318 --> 00:18:15,885
Felicity. Want to play a game?

360
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,119
What game am I playing?

361
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:18,754
Playing the reason
that you know so much

362
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:20,356
about The Ghosts is because

363
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:23,726
you've been helping the
team behind my back game.

364
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,165
These guys have got cluster bombs now?
You gotta be kidding me.

365
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:31,534
Well, that's why I'm here, to see if
you're aware of any potential targets.

366
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:33,503
The only thing that I'm aware of

367
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,137
is that I want you to stay as far
away from this mess as possible.

368
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:36,739
Dad, I thought
we'd moved past this.

369
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,140
We've moved past
a lot of things,

370
00:18:38,142 --> 00:18:39,975
and I am glad, really.
But I don't want you

371
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:41,744
mixing it up with these psychos.

372
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,046
Even after what happened
to the leadership?

373
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:46,749
I mean, honestly. I thought
that you would be happy

374
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,783
to have our help.

375
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:48,918
Do I look happy?

376
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,521
Dad, The Ghosts were
dangerous before

377
00:18:51,523 --> 00:18:53,323
they go their hands on
experimental explosives.

378
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:55,858
How are you gonna feel when
they take out a city block,

379
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,227
knowing you didn't
do anything to stop it.

380
00:18:59,564 --> 00:19:04,100
Have you heard of anything going
on that's a potential target?

381
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:06,536
Landmarks, Starling General,
et cetera.

382
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:09,272
What about city events? Any
dignitaries coming to town?

383
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,573
A few ballgames, concerts.

384
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:12,242
Not that there's anyone
to buy a ticket.

385
00:19:12,244 --> 00:19:14,043
Train station's getting
reopened tomorrow night

386
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:15,678
for that new rail line.

387
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,381
And Starling General
is having a canned food drive.

388
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:22,051
People don't come
to Star City anymore, Laurel.

389
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:23,753
They want to leave.

390
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:26,522
Who is the cutest?

391
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:29,125
Who is the cutest, ever, ever?

392
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,795
Playing with her like that,
I'm pretty sure it's you.

393
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,632
It's amazing how everything
else can just melt away

394
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,401
except for her.

395
00:19:38,403 --> 00:19:40,570
What's melting tonight?

396
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:43,072
I know it's been
a rough few months.

397
00:19:43,074 --> 00:19:44,774
These men you're dealing with.

398
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:46,976
Tonight it's just one man.

399
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,245
Oliver's back.

400
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:51,046
That didn't take long.

401
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:52,848
If you knew he was coming back.
Why didn't you warn me?

402
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,484
What's the saying?

403
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,286
"Only the dead have
seen the end of war."

404
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:57,853
Oliver's not a soldier.

405
00:19:57,855 --> 00:19:58,854
Isn't he?

406
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:00,222
That's pretty forgiving,

407
00:20:00,224 --> 00:20:02,659
considering he kidnapped you
6 months ago.

408
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,560
You know why he did.

409
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:07,797
You have to let go
of it sometime. I have.

410
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,231
That's because
you're better than me.

411
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:12,101
That's one of the reasons
why I love you.

412
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:13,969
It was war, Johnny.

413
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:15,871
Maybe not against a country,

414
00:20:15,873 --> 00:20:17,840
but it was war.

415
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,543
And in time of war,
we do what we have to do.

416
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:21,644
Really, Lyla?

417
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:24,013
I mean, that include
lying to me?

418
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,115
Lying to Felicity?

419
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:27,883
What was the point?

420
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:31,321
Oliver did what he thought
he had to do to defeat Ra's.

421
00:20:31,323 --> 00:20:33,589
I'm not saying
he made the right choice.

422
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:36,025
But if Oliver Queen
always made the right choice,

423
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,027
he wouldn't need you.

424
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:43,098
I used to think that
yelling Oliver was scary.

425
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,501
I'm starting to think that
silent Oliver is a lot worse.

426
00:20:45,503 --> 00:20:47,337
I'm just going over the past
5 months in my head.

427
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:50,139
When you got food poisoning
when we were in Thailand...

428
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:52,274
Yes. I might have been
secretly working with the team,

429
00:20:52,276 --> 00:20:54,711
but I didn't exactly lie
about the food poisoning.

430
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,379
Laab Moo is extremely
hard to digest.

431
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:59,716
What about when you missed our
boat, missed in Positano?

432
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:02,385
Ok, that one was a little fib.

433
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,487
Bali?

434
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:07,056
Felicity, you said there
wasn't even email in Bali.

435
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,290
I know!

436
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,092
But we both know
I'm just that good.

437
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,127
I don't understand. The whole
point of starting over

438
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:13,863
was to get away
from all of this,

439
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:15,631
and we were both right there
together leading that charge.

440
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:18,634
I know. And I thought
that's what we needed.

441
00:21:18,636 --> 00:21:20,336
And the first few months
were great, really great.

442
00:21:20,338 --> 00:21:21,838
- Okay. - But then when you
and Laura Hoffman

443
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,172
started exchanging cooking tips,

444
00:21:23,174 --> 00:21:25,375
I secretly wanted
to gouge out my eyes.

445
00:21:25,377 --> 00:21:27,343
I thought you were happy.

446
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,345
I was. Deliriously
happy with you,

447
00:21:29,347 --> 00:21:31,981
but bored with everything else.

448
00:21:31,983 --> 00:21:37,119
I missed this. I missed saving
the city and helping people.

449
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,889
It gives my life purpose.

450
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:42,525
And I wish I got the same thrill

451
00:21:42,527 --> 00:21:44,594
from picking between the dimpled
flatware or the scalloped,

452
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,562
but I just don't.

453
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:49,632
Hey. I don't care
that you lied to me.

454
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:50,767
I don't care.

455
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,735
I care that the entire time

456
00:21:52,737 --> 00:21:55,605
we were supposed to be
away together,

457
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,673
part of you was still here,

458
00:21:57,675 --> 00:22:00,877
I love every moment
that I'm with you,

459
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:02,278
no matter where we are.

460
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,315
What's that?

461
00:22:06,317 --> 00:22:09,318
I hacked Kord Industries to
check their design schematics

462
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,953
for their bombs. Turns out they
have a GPS tracker built in.

463
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,221
Can you find out where it is?

464
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:13,756
At least where they've been.

465
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:15,357
GPS is offline now, but
their last location was...

466
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,259
Admiral Transport Interchange.

467
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:19,261
It's a truck depot
outside Pennytown.

468
00:22:19,263 --> 00:22:20,963
Closed up shop two months ago.

469
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,965
I'll call Thea.
You get Laurel and Dig.

470
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,734
This might be a good time
to tell you that Cisco

471
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:27,269
worked up a little something
before he knew you were leaving.

472
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:28,704
A new suit.

473
00:22:28,706 --> 00:22:31,373
We're not staying long enough
for a new suit.

474
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:33,532
ADMIRAL TRANSPORT
INTERCHANGE HUB - NO TRESPASSING

475
00:22:36,213 --> 00:22:38,280
I knew there were places
like this.

476
00:22:38,282 --> 00:22:41,183
Owners must have left when
the city started tanking.

477
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:45,020
Well, our new friends seem
to have found a use for it.

478
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:47,089
Gentlemen, the world's a...

479
00:22:47,091 --> 00:22:48,424
it's a funny place.

480
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:49,892
It resists change.

481
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:51,393
It fights progress.

482
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:54,263
And so the only way
to move things forward

483
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:56,599
is to fight back.

484
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:59,602
And you men are here today
because you understand that.

485
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:01,838
But our cause is only as strong

486
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,574
as our weakest man.

487
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:07,527
Mr. Alvarez,
please step forward.

488
00:23:08,998 --> 00:23:12,366
You commanded the hijacking
the other night,

489
00:23:12,368 --> 00:23:14,434
the cluster bombs
from Kord Industries.

490
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,469
Yes, sir.
We encountered some resistance,

491
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:18,705
but we handled it.

492
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:21,674
Hand... hand...

493
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:23,777
Well, I guess my definition
of "handled"

494
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,245
is a little different
than yours.

495
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:27,948
You see, when I "handle"
a problem,

496
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,783
the problem dies.

497
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:30,884
Sir, we got away
with the bombs...

498
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:34,955
You know, I love this town
in the fall.

499
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:37,224
I mean, yes, it looks
pretty much the same

500
00:23:37,226 --> 00:23:38,992
as it does in the other
3 seasons,

501
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:41,295
but I admire consistency.

502
00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:45,598
I respect dependability.

503
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,301
And you've shown me neither.

504
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:50,770
So now, allow me
to show you something.

505
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:53,373
It's another kind of beauty.

506
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:57,244
It's the manipulation
of primordial energies.

507
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:59,746
No? Over your head? Yeah.

508
00:23:59,748 --> 00:24:01,481
The grazing of the levers

509
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,084
that God uses to move the world.

510
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:06,586
No? No?

511
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:09,856
This.

512
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:14,261
Oh, my God.

513
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:15,829
What the hell is that?

514
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:20,834
Move!

515
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:51,465
Hey, Speedy!

516
00:24:51,735 --> 00:24:52,750
SCPD!

517
00:24:52,751 --> 00:24:54,233
Put your hands in the air.

518
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:58,972
What are they gonna do
with the explosives?

519
00:24:58,974 --> 00:25:00,173
Train...

520
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:01,475
Tell me!

521
00:25:01,477 --> 00:25:04,211
They're gonna destroy
Star City station.

522
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:05,765
Hands where I can see them.

523
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:11,084
We got to go.

524
00:25:11,086 --> 00:25:13,153
We got to go.

525
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,577
Oh, I remember that look.

526
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:30,878
That is not a good look.

527
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,647
We found out what they
had planned, at least.

528
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:34,982
They're gonna use the explosives
on the new train station.

529
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:38,052
Ah, pretty sure I had that
one in the office pool.

530
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:39,754
Too soon?

531
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:41,255
They're probably planning the
attack for tomorrow night,

532
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:43,223
celebrate the re-opening
of the new rail line.

533
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:45,459
Are we not gonna talk about
what just happened?

534
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:48,295
That dude just killed
that guy by touching him.

535
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,130
Wait, we're dealing
with a metahuman?

536
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,331
Like we didn't have
enough problems?

537
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,633
He wasn't a metahuman.

538
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,368
Oliver, what that man
did was not natural.

539
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,737
I know. It was mystical.

540
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:59,506
How can you be so sure?

541
00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:01,909
Because I've seen things.

542
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:05,012
There's things that
can't be explained,

543
00:26:05,014 --> 00:26:06,313
even by science.

544
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,615
I suppose you aren't
going to tell us

545
00:26:07,617 --> 00:26:08,983
about these things
you've seen, Oliver.

546
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,052
We need to focus on finding
the cluster bombs.

547
00:26:11,054 --> 00:26:12,419
Can you activate the GPS?

548
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:14,021
Yeah, eventually.
But I'm pretty sure

549
00:26:14,023 --> 00:26:15,522
the train station's gonna
be blown up by then.

550
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:19,426
Fine. So we do this
the old-fashioned way.

551
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:21,996
So this is the
old-fashioned way?

552
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,431
Can we maybe discuss last night?

553
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:27,468
It's pretty amazing, right?

554
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,204
But how could you ever
want to give up that rush?

555
00:26:30,206 --> 00:26:31,606
Extremely easily.

556
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:33,407
It's... it's not what
I'm talking about.

557
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:35,476
You seemed a little
out of control.

558
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:37,311
This coming from the guy

559
00:26:37,313 --> 00:26:39,680
who used to use criminals
as target practice.

560
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:42,950
I'm amazed by how far
you've come in 5 months,

561
00:26:42,952 --> 00:26:46,220
and I'm under no illusions
that this isn't a violent life.

562
00:26:46,222 --> 00:26:49,156
I just, I want you to
remember that it's restraint

563
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:51,558
separating us from them.

564
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,230
Well, you've managed to
be back, what, 24 hours

565
00:26:56,232 --> 00:26:57,598
before giving me a lecture.

566
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,967
Think I owe Laurel 50 bucks.

567
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:01,869
I'm being serious.

568
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,904
How long has this been
going on for?

569
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:05,806
Nothing is going on.

570
00:27:05,808 --> 00:27:09,209
Ok, I've just... just
become a better fighter.

571
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:12,513
A better fighter remains in
control when they fight.

572
00:27:12,515 --> 00:27:14,414
Is everything ok?

573
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,651
It's not ok.

574
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:19,720
My brother can't seem to
stay out of my business.

575
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:25,026
Any luck?

576
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:27,128
No.

577
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,964
Does Thea seem
a little off to you?

578
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:31,632
No, she's fine.

579
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:34,101
Just a little too
aggressive maybe.

580
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:37,404
Remember, you were the same
way when you started out.

581
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:40,274
Saw that you took my advice
on the identity concealment.

582
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:42,409
Oliver, man, what are we doing?

583
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,711
Pretending everything's normal,

584
00:27:43,713 --> 00:27:45,312
that we are normal?

585
00:27:45,314 --> 00:27:46,613
I'm looking for a way in.

586
00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:47,982
I was furious to think
that you trusted

587
00:27:47,984 --> 00:27:49,984
Malcolm Merlin more
than you trust me.

588
00:27:49,986 --> 00:27:52,153
But then I realized that
I'm not angry at you,

589
00:27:52,155 --> 00:27:54,521
I'm angry at myself for
thinking you're someone

590
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:55,923
that you clearly aren't.

591
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,825
I don't know what that means.

592
00:27:57,827 --> 00:28:00,161
Oliver, after everything
we've been through, man,

593
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:03,164
I couldn't fathom why
you didn't trust me.

594
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,199
But then I realized
you couldn't.

595
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:07,334
It's not who you are.

596
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:11,038
You don't trust. You don't love.

597
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,574
You were able to fool
Ra's and join the League

598
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:16,711
because inside you are every
bit as dark as they are.

599
00:28:19,222 --> 00:28:20,548
K9 UNIT

600
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:22,016
Thank you for coming.

601
00:28:22,018 --> 00:28:23,217
Responding to a bomb threat's

602
00:28:23,219 --> 00:28:24,985
kind of in the SCPD
job description.

603
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:27,154
You know what I mean. I'm
glad we're working together.

604
00:28:27,156 --> 00:28:29,690
It seems like you're working
with a lot of people these days.

605
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:30,858
What's that supposed to mean?

606
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,359
- Excuse me.
- Dad.

607
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:35,162
Prodigal Arrow returns.

608
00:28:35,164 --> 00:28:36,396
Captain Lance.

609
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:37,798
I thought that was you
last night,

610
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,633
some mask over your head.
Felt like old times.

611
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,068
Only trying to help.

612
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,837
That were true,
you wouldn't have come back.

613
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:45,405
This town started going to crap
the moment you put on that hood.

614
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:47,041
You brought madness
into all of our lives,

615
00:28:47,043 --> 00:28:50,044
and the monster you were
inspired monsters.

616
00:28:50,046 --> 00:28:53,013
Maybe.

617
00:28:53,015 --> 00:28:55,049
But I'm not a monster anymore.

618
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:58,085
Then what are you?

619
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:13,567
Nice nap?

620
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:16,536
I wasn't napping. I was drugged.

621
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:17,805
Where's Waller?

622
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:20,107
Back in Coast City
sleeping off the Scotch.

623
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:21,341
Wake her up.

624
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:22,542
I want to know what
I'm doing here.

625
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:24,011
Director Waller has asked me

626
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,847
to thank you for agreeing
to take on this mission.

627
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:30,517
I didn't agree to take on any...

628
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,052
Sorry. We're in a bit
of a clock here.

629
00:29:32,054 --> 00:29:33,687
Now, you're getting
off this plane.

630
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,055
You can do that with
a chute on your back

631
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:37,024
or a bullet in your head.
Your call.

632
00:29:45,601 --> 00:29:47,301
Why is Waller doing this?

633
00:29:47,303 --> 00:29:48,669
Guess she likes you.

634
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:50,470
I didn't think Waller
could like anybody.

635
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:52,273
Plus, you know the terrain.

636
00:29:52,275 --> 00:29:53,440
What terrain?

637
00:29:53,442 --> 00:29:55,943
Your job is to infiltrate
the area,

638
00:29:55,945 --> 00:29:58,078
assess the threat,
and report back.

639
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,782
You have AES-encrypted
communication gear in your pack.

640
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:05,719
Now, according to our Intel,

641
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,122
your target may be
radar capable,

642
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:10,124
so you'll have to HALO in.

643
00:30:10,126 --> 00:30:12,927
So when you think
you're about to splat,

644
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:15,696
only then do you pull the shoot.

645
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:22,736
Wait, is that...

646
00:30:28,782 --> 00:30:30,577
You have mopey face.

647
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,947
Were you worried after
5 months of happiness

648
00:30:32,949 --> 00:30:34,681
that you weren't going to
be able to make it anymore?

649
00:30:34,683 --> 00:30:36,350
I ran into Lance.

650
00:30:36,352 --> 00:30:39,286
And he gave you a hug
because he missed you?

651
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:41,922
Yeah, well, it's not just Lance.

652
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:45,326
Thea. There is something
wrong with Thea.

653
00:30:45,328 --> 00:30:47,228
She doesn't want my help
and neither does Diggle.

654
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,464
We should never have
come back here.

655
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:52,699
Let's go. Let's go home.

656
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:54,301
You don't want to go home.

657
00:30:54,303 --> 00:30:57,037
I love our new home.

658
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,606
And I love you.

659
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,108
But I also love it here,

660
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,809
and you can't honestly
tell me that you don't.

661
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:05,512
Yeah, no, of course
I miss aspects of it.

662
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:09,016
The sense of purpose,
the idea of helping people.

663
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:10,851
But Lance was right.

664
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:12,419
About what?

665
00:31:14,523 --> 00:31:16,290
A few months ago he told me

666
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,158
that all I brought
back from the island

667
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,162
was pain, misery, and darkness.

668
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:26,267
Of course I knew that the
moment we came back here,

669
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:28,302
that darkness would
be waiting for me.

670
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,070
Well, he's wrong. Dead wrong.

671
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:32,439
You didn't bring the darkness
back with you from Lian Yu.

672
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:33,807
But, Felicity,
I'm telling you that

673
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,377
the only way I know how
to fight the darkness

674
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:39,613
is to be darkness.
That is why I left.

675
00:31:39,615 --> 00:31:42,849
And I don't want to be that
type of person anymore.

676
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:46,220
Maybe you just need to be
a different kind of person.

677
00:31:46,222 --> 00:31:50,857
And you're not doing this
alone anymore.

678
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:52,526
Train station was a bust.

679
00:31:52,528 --> 00:31:54,028
No incendiaries on the platform,

680
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,030
on the tracks, or inside
any of the trains.

681
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:57,597
Yeah, but if there's no
bomb in the station,

682
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,401
then how did they
expect to blow it up?

683
00:32:00,403 --> 00:32:03,070
You didn't bring
the darkness here.

684
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,672
The bombs aren't at the station

685
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:06,773
because they're
bringing them in.

686
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:08,208
On a train.

687
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,609
When's the reopening
ceremony scheduled for?

688
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:11,345
9:58, to coincide
with the arrival

689
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:13,080
of the first high speed
train from Central City.

690
00:32:13,082 --> 00:32:14,248
Let's suit up.

691
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,882
You should suit up, too.

692
00:32:15,884 --> 00:32:17,251
What?

693
00:32:53,837 --> 00:32:56,604
Get me closer.

694
00:32:56,606 --> 00:32:57,378
I'm trying.

695
00:32:57,379 --> 00:32:58,538
STAR CITY PRESENTS THE ORBITER

696
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:00,761
Ladies and gentlemen.
The first train of Central City

697
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:02,069
will be arrive shortly.

698
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:05,540
Everybody get out of here.

699
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:06,807
It's not safe.

700
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:15,350
Out of the way, out of
the way, out of the way.

701
00:33:21,253 --> 00:33:22,790
You're really strong.

702
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,958
- Go.
- Thank you.

703
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,393
This is SCPD.

704
00:33:25,395 --> 00:33:29,764
Everyone quickly and quietly
evacuate the station.

705
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:37,272
Everyone move calmly
towards the exits. Calmly.

706
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:39,540
The train is 10 minutes out.

707
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:41,876
6 minutes till
safest blast radius.

708
00:34:02,098 --> 00:34:03,731
Situation report.

709
00:34:05,702 --> 00:34:08,503
Mr. Slater.

710
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:14,542
Sorry. He had to get off
at an earlier stop.

711
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:15,391
You can't be the Arrow.

712
00:34:15,392 --> 00:34:16,906
He died. So who are you?

713
00:34:16,907 --> 00:34:18,424
You are about to find out.

714
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:22,750
Stop the train.

715
00:34:22,752 --> 00:34:24,218
No, I don't want to.

716
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,454
Even if I did, I couldn't.

717
00:34:26,456 --> 00:34:29,056
I destroyed the braking
system 20 miles ago.

718
00:34:29,058 --> 00:34:31,726
Willing to die to destroy
a train station?

719
00:34:31,728 --> 00:34:33,194
No, that would be ridiculous.

720
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,229
Then how are you planning on
getting off the train?

721
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:37,432
Oh, you don't know
who I am, do you?

722
00:34:39,569 --> 00:34:42,269
I'm Damian Darhk.

723
00:35:05,962 --> 00:35:07,729
Is that all you got?

724
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,138
It seems you've much
in common with the Arrow.

725
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,640
You're both dead.

726
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,387
Thank you.

727
00:35:35,024 --> 00:35:37,024
We need to stop the train.

728
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:38,092
Got any ideas?

729
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,828
Yeah, blow it up.

730
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,777
So what are you
gonna call yourself now?

731
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:08,712
Everybody thinks Roy was the Arrow.

732
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:11,949
He won't need a code name if
he's headed back to Ivy town.

733
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,155
Well, then I guess
I need a code name.

734
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:21,458
Felicity and I,
we have missed this.

735
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,026
We've missed all of you.

736
00:36:23,028 --> 00:36:26,396
And the city is far
worse off than we thought.

737
00:36:26,398 --> 00:36:27,631
What are you talking about?

738
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:29,466
The man leading The
Ghost is Damian Darhk.

739
00:36:29,468 --> 00:36:31,235
Darhk left Star City months ago.

740
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:32,469
Why would he come back?

741
00:36:32,471 --> 00:36:33,804
Did Ra's tell you
anything about Darhk

742
00:36:33,806 --> 00:36:35,372
that would give us
any idea about his agenda?

743
00:36:35,374 --> 00:36:39,509
He said that Damian Darhk
had a hive of operatives

744
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:40,510
at his disposal.

745
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:41,711
A hive?

746
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:43,513
That was the exact word he used?

747
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:45,482
Yes. Why?

748
00:36:45,484 --> 00:36:47,751
Does it mean something to you?

749
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:49,219
Who would want to kill Andy?

750
00:36:49,221 --> 00:36:53,090
Don't know their
names, just an alias.

751
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:54,491
HIVE.

752
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:56,827
No.

753
00:36:57,997 --> 00:36:59,296
No, nothing.

754
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:00,630
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

755
00:37:00,632 --> 00:37:02,499
I'm fine, man. I'm just beat.

756
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:05,102
Plus, I have a little girl
to tuck in.

757
00:37:05,104 --> 00:37:07,171
John.

758
00:37:07,173 --> 00:37:08,305
John.

759
00:37:08,307 --> 00:37:09,506
Listen, I'm, um,

760
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:11,641
I'm not quite there yet, Oliver,

761
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:13,410
so let's not do this right now.

762
00:37:13,412 --> 00:37:15,378
No, I know. I get it.

763
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,115
But there is something
we do need to do.

764
00:37:18,117 --> 00:37:21,384
- Captain, new problem.
- Seriously?

765
00:37:21,386 --> 00:37:23,520
Someone's hacked into the
emergency broadcast system.

766
00:37:23,522 --> 00:37:25,322
They've taken over
all the networks.

767
00:37:25,324 --> 00:37:28,158
6 months ago, the Arrow died.

768
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,328
But what he stood for didn't.

769
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:35,966
It lived on in the heroes
who took up his mantle.

770
00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:38,302
People who believe
that this city

771
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:41,138
should never descend
into hopelessness.

772
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,341
Who believe although light
is full of darkness,

773
00:37:44,343 --> 00:37:48,145
that darkness can be
the key to find light.

774
00:37:48,147 --> 00:37:51,681
And tonight,
I am declaring my intention

775
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:53,516
to stand with them,

776
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:56,854
to fight for this city,

777
00:37:56,856 --> 00:38:01,158
to be the symbol of hope
that the Arrow never was.

778
00:38:02,661 --> 00:38:10,249
I am the Green Arrow.

779
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:28,151
Who are you?

780
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:30,453
Answer me.

781
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:10,458
Kanjigar septum vohnostrum.

782
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:24,905
You have a visitor.

783
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,106
Sorry about the arm.

784
00:39:35,108 --> 00:39:37,476
Unnecessary subterfuge
to prevent anyone

785
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:40,111
from suspecting your
involvement with the HIVE.

786
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:41,212
What do you want?

787
00:39:41,214 --> 00:39:42,848
Well, I'm a little disappointed

788
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,883
the train station isn't
a smoldering pile of ash.

789
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:48,053
I'm not. Mass murder,
killing innocents.

790
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,354
I didn't sign up for this.

791
00:39:49,356 --> 00:39:50,956
You signed up to follow
my instructions,

792
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:52,558
to do my will.

793
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,392
I want to know everything
about this Green Arrow,

794
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:55,794
where he lives,
and who he loves,

795
00:39:55,796 --> 00:39:57,228
and I want him off
the boards by the time

796
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,564
my associates arrive.

797
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:00,966
And if I don't help you?

798
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:02,400
Well, then I would be surprised.

799
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:04,736
'Cause I think I made
it abundantly clear

800
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:07,205
you don't have a choice.

801
00:40:11,044 --> 00:40:13,545
So my guilt for displacing Thea

802
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:16,381
is only slightly outweighed

803
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:19,751
by how amazing this place is.

804
00:40:21,655 --> 00:40:23,121
Thea's actually been
living with Laurel

805
00:40:23,123 --> 00:40:24,456
for the past few months.

806
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:28,594
Ra's stabbed her
right over there.

807
00:40:29,597 --> 00:40:30,996
We can get a rug.

808
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:33,465
You know, I'd hate
to disappoint you,

809
00:40:33,467 --> 00:40:36,802
but that speech
is pretty hopeful.

810
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:38,403
Why would that disappoint me?

811
00:40:38,405 --> 00:40:40,939
Oh, you know how you
said you didn't know

812
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:43,609
how to be a hero
without the darkness?

813
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:48,179
And I know how you hate
being wrong.

814
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:12,303
Sorry I missed the funeral.

815
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,641
- Zoom?
- Yeah.

816
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:17,475
There was a time I would have
thought this was my fault,

817
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:20,546
that I brought this
darkness upon us.

818
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:22,581
Now I know it's not my fault.

819
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:24,315
It's my responsibility.

820
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:26,818
Responsibility to do what?

821
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,254
To end it.

822
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:30,488
I'm gonna kill him.

823
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,691
Is there anything I can do?

824
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:35,160
I want to be left alone.

825
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:36,562
Ok.

826
00:41:51,186 --> 00:42:26,762
